Nate Silver just tweeted his final Senate prediction: Our final Senate forecast has Dems at 52-53 seats (net loss of 0-1) and a 95% chance to keep the majority. The other day Chris Hayes said, rightly I think, that one of the most underreported stories of this election is the GOP blowing its chance to retake the Senate two cycles in a row by nominating crackpots in key states.

Feeling ever so guilty that I did zero campaigning this year considering that I put hundreds of hours into the '08 Obama campaign so I'll really feel like crap if he loses Pennsylvania. Heading out to vote in a few minutes, wonder if that 90 year old lady is still looking up the registration cards at my polling place? She's dear but stone deaf and can't see very well so sometimes it takes two or three minutes of my yelling my name at her and her squinting at the file box of registration cards and asking if my name is something totally different than what I just said.

This morning, I woke up to see news which calmed my troubled, worried soul. What would the last major block of undecided voters opt for, the Motörhead Faithful. Now Lemmy has spoken to the nation through Rolling Stone:
Interviewer: When I interviewed Chuck [Berry], I mentioned the segregated venues he used to play in the South when he was younger. He teared up and recalled, "My dad said, 'I don't know if we'll live to see it but one day we will [have an African-American President] – and I thank God that I have." 

Lemmy: I would have said America wasn't ready for it. And I don't think they were, because they're trying to drag him down now. I mean, the poor fucker's only just gotten rid of all that George Bush shit that he left, or is trying to. And he's being stonewalled by the fucking Congress all the time. I don't know how he's gotten anything done. They should be glad. I mean the alternative is Mitt Romney. Please, please don't vote for Mitt Romney. Fuck him. Repeal abortion law is the first thing he'll do. Fucking monster.
As Lemmy goes, so goes the nation.

According to Nate:

Obama wins popular vote 87.3%
Romney wins popular vote 12.7%
Obama wins popular vote but loses electoral college 0.6%
Romney wins popular vote but loses electoral college 4.9%

I think I heard that was more possible after Sandy. I may end up being thankful for the electoral college after today, much as I hate to say it.

My recollection is that the last few weeks have brought the chances down as Obama has generally recovered from his first debate dip. I've heard a few people say that Sandy (and the various disruptions caused by it, including the rather dubious vote-by-email and just-vote-anywhere amelioration schemes being tried in NJ and NY) proves the Electoral College is a good thing, because it smooths out local disruptions. I still think the Democrats could run up the score a lot easier if the popular vote mattered; their power centers are where all the people are.

I still think the Democrats could run up the score a lot easier if the popular vote mattered; their power centers are where all the people are.

I agree with this, but I also wonder how crazy the voter suppression would become. It took me about an hour and fifteen minutes to early vote in Miami Beach, and I was pretty lucky. But there were folks locally who waited six to seven hours, and Gov. Scott still refused to extend early voting. Not to mention, the Miami-Dade County incompetence that happened on Sunday. 

Then in Ohio, there's only one early voting place per county, which favors the small, rural counties over the highly populated ones. 

I'd hate to see what a 50 state voter suppression strategy would look like, instead of the pockets of voter suppression in big cities in swing states.

That said, I completely understand the desire to feel that your vote counts in non-swing states and the wish for decent third party options and so on.

So going into polling day, my feelings are kind of the inverse of this time in 2004. Then I was thinking "I'm sure Kerry isn't going to win. But maybe... there's always hope". This year it's more "I'm sure Obama's going to win. But maybe... there's always fear".

My wife lodged her absentee ballot a few weeks ago, so there's nothing to do now but wait. She did say that if Romney wins she'll become an Australian citizen, so maybe I, just personally, come out ahead either way. :)

I hope that one day a website like the Google voting page will be a place to vote from.

Part of me wants that too, but as the years go on and I see more of how people behave online, I sour more on the idea with each passing day. At least for now.

I think that the physical act of voting (traveling to the polling place, standing in line etc) puts a measure of accountability into the mix for the individual. It makes us more aware that we are doing something important as opposed to voting on whether we think the recent Star Wars sale to Disney was valid via TMZ. It also forces people to stand up in person for the vote they should be considered a near sacred right. And it deters drunk-voting...at least to some degree.

So, while the technology would be nice to have available to use(and actually exists already anyway) , peoples' maturity about their responsibility to vote and the intersection of that with a relatively new technology needs a little time to flesh out. Looked at another way - we are not adult enough to vote online yet at least in terms of conducting ourselves like adults should online.

All this talk of 45 minute to 90 minute waits (on work days, no less) makes me wonder -- with voluntary voting no less -- the fuck you people are doing.
I have voted in lots of elections, and I think the longest I have had to wait was around 20 minutes (four songs).

I remember, because we voted Howard's Liberal party out, my my T-shirt said "Un-Australian", and I felt every of those long, long minutes.

But 45 minutes? And you have push-button machines. I had to number 1-110 boxes and all at the end of it, in pencil.

It really pisses me off when jobs and unemployment numbers come up and Republicans say that the new jobs are only part-time. As if Obama is telling the Wal-Marts of the country not to hire full-time people so they don't have to pay their employees benefits.

Turnout seems to be really high in Miami-Dade and Broward Counties right now, by the non-scentific data of friends posting pictures of lines on facebook. As a general rule for Florida, if there's large enough turnout in Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami-Dade Counties, we turn the state blue.

I think the problem is that states control aspect and get decide how voting will occur. A few of them have little incentive to fix the problem or make voting easer.

The efforts of that skeleton-looking Governor of yours may be producing an effect opposite of what he intended. The stories of those who were denied their vote early, or who had to wait 6 hours to vote, got a lot of people fired up to make damn sure their vote was counted.

From Salon:

“The method of execution chosen,” for this effort, notes March in his affidavit for the Fitrakis/Arnebeck injunction lawsuit, “is unspeakably stupid, excessively complex and insanely risky. In medical terms it is the equivalent of doing open heart surgery as part of a method of removing somebody’s hemorrhoids. Whoever came up with this idea is either the dumbest Information Technology ‘professional’ in the US or has criminal intent against the Ohio election process.”

But 45 minutes? And you have push-button machines. 

Yes, but, we also have this fetish for cutting budgets. The result is that, while we may have push-button machines, many polling places will only have a tiny handful of machines, which causes a back-up and long lines...or people giving-up and going home without voting (which would count as "mission accomplished" for a certain side of the political spectrum)

Me, I feel pretty confident that Mr Obama will win. I'm less thrilled about the prospect than I was 4 years ago. It's surely a better thing, but.

What my dream is -- and it's totally unlikely -- is that the Republican party loses so comprehensively and decisively and humiliatingly this time that the party breaks up into a party of actual, real conservatives, conservatives of actual ideas and dedication to principles and stuff, and a new evil twin party of crazy lunatic teaparty rape-crazed lunatic god-struck assholes, Rusty Venture stylee.

That would be great, because a real, honest, ethical conservative Republican party might just correct the worst excesses of the Democrats, and the loopy bastards could rally around the Loopy Flag, and things would still be entertaining without being terrifying so much any more.

Ain't gonna happen, I know: but I can dream. So hey, if you're American, and confident about Obama winning, and therefore why-bothering: get up, go, vote, and increase the chances of CRITICAL HITS.

Why isn't this a national holiday?

I've become curious if turning Election Day into a national holiday would depress turnout in some places by turning it into a late-fall long weekend. Maybe the regime of week- or month-long voting periods we've been experimenting with is actually better.

Isn't there a federal law that allows you to take a half or full day off work to vote, with protection from any adverse action from your employers as a result of taking the time off?

Not a full day, or even officially a half day, but employers are required to let you go vote. Whether they actually do or not is another question; enforcement in employment law is spotty at best.

Here in Texas we do. I don't vote straight ticket. The Dems didn't run an opponent to my Republican congressman, so I got some perverse pleasure voting for his Libertarian opponent. There were also one or two state offices where the choice was Republican, Libertarian or Green. In Texas, the judges are partisan elections, but in some jurisdictions, voting straight ticket will not select any judicial races (you'll have to do those one-by-one), as discussed in the recent West Wing reunion video.

I prefer some sort of national federally-standardized vote by mail or extended vote peroid. Even if we made election day a "national holiday" it's not like the whole country can shut down. Hospitals must be staffed. Utility companies, police, firefighters, other public services. Most restaurants would probably not close. Bars would certainly not.

So we have a holiday where all the banks and big companies are closed, but for all the nurses, firefighters, homeless shelters workers, bus drivers etc. it is just another workday. Doesn't seem ideal to me. Let's just have an "election week" so everyone can vote conveniently and focus on partying as the results come in.

I like this too, and it's why I still almost always go to my polling place on election day, instead of going to city hall and voting early or getting an absentee ballot. But I recognized that I am fortunate in that my employer doesn't care if I get in late, or that I don't have to get to a second job in the evening. Given that everyone tends to procrastinate I think you would still have large crowds on the last day of elections but I think having well-managed other options makes it more fair than making election day a "national holiday" where plenty of people will still be working.

From reddit/r/nyc: The wife and I just went to vote at PS 158 on York Ave. It was the most disorganized voting experience I've ever been through. There is a line to get your ballot, a line for privacy booths to bubble-in your vote and then a line to scan your ballot. When we got in line to scan our ballots, 3 of the 4 scanners were already down and poll workers were getting upset. Then, with 3 people ahead of us, the 4th scanner jammed. They have now opened the "emergency ballot boxes" where you just slip your ballot in and it gets scanned later. I don't feel so confident about the process. Everyone get out and vote early today or make sure you give yourself enough time. It took about an hour. We actually heard a poll worker say, "It's not my problem!"

As Lemmy goes, so goes the nation.

If you like to watch the polls, I tell you I'm your man
You're up some, down some, it's still the same to me
The pleasure is to follow, it makes no difference what you say
I don't share your hate, I just want to aggregate
Five Thirty Eight!
Five Thirty Eight!

Watching for the flyer, dancing with the devil
Going with the flow, it's all just math to me
Up seven or down eleven, all the internet watching you
Rassmusen or Pew, Gallup or Quinnipac U.
Five Thirty Eight!
Five Thirty Eight!

You know I'm born to crunch, national poll's for fools
But that's the way I like it baby
I don't want to blog forever
And don't forget Unskewed!

Pushing up the margin, I know you've got to see me
Read 'em and weep, Ohio's changed again!
I see it in the exit surveys, take one look and die
The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be,
Five Thirty Eight!
Five Thirty Eight!

99.5% chance of Romney win in my state. So there's still a chance! Take that Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkanasas, Oklahoma, Kentucky, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Utah, North Dakota, and Idaho. We're bluer than you!

Also, about 2/3 of the seats I'm voting for are unopposed, mostly held by Republicans. I need to find a good name to write in for those seats

Today is going to be an exciting and only a little nervewracking day. If the polls and the aggregates are correct I think we'll get Obama elected 332-206, gain 1 democratic seat in the senate (no small feat given that Dems had to defend a ridiculous number of seats this year), and gain about 5-10 seats in the House. I'm not going to predict Speaker Pelosi but the sheer rage that would cause in Redlandia (where I live) would be delicious.

Oh well I guess I have to content myself with replacing 2 liberal justices to the Supreme Court and hoping beyond hope that the sheer amount of bile that Thomas and Scalia produce will force them to step down for health reasons during the next 4 years.

Of course I'll probably stay up to see election results well into the night just on the off chance that we have another 2000. No way in hell am I waking up to that. But Hawaii and Alaska are on their own.

Go vote in the middle of the day. Everyone with day jobs is out early and late waiting to vote, so take advantage of the lull in the afternoon.

Polls opened at 7:00 in MA, I got to the local fire station at 7:15, and it took me about 45 minutes to get through the line. They weren't kidding about record turnout. I think we just had a surprising number of "significant" elections and questions on the ballot - Senate seat, doctor-assisted suicide, legalized medical marijuana, and oh yeah don't let the ex-governor take over the White House.

Those buttons are also sometimes really screwed up; In North Carolina it records no vote for president, for instance, basically as a deliberate voter suppression tactic.


I know several NCers have already weighed in on this but I wanted to mention that the first thing you see on the ballot is the Presidential race (which in NC includes Obama, Romney, and Johnson) and below that section in a separate space is the straight ticket vote. Also I was physically handed a strip of paper that reminded me that the straight party vote did not include the President. You would have to be really blind, deaf, and dumb to miss that.

All this talk of 45 minute to 90 minute waits (on work days, no less) makes me wonder -- with voluntary voting no less -- the fuck you people are doing.

The long lines are probably the result of a lot more people turning up to vote instead of blowing it off. Seriously, we have one of the worst voter turnouts of any democracy; I think the New York State democratic primary had only an 11% turnout. Typically we have about 50-60% voter turnout at national elections.

So the long lines make me think that this may be "more people are finally voting for a change," and that makes me REALLY happy.

As my contribution to subscribe to this thread, here's a link to yesterday's Diane Rehm show, a concerning analysis of the voter suppression, harassment and intimidation that's going on around the country. AS far as I'm concerned this is the most disgustingly unAmerican thing of all, and it should be roundly deplored by people on all sides. 

I hope it's really not too long before we can have secure votes by email. There could still be stations for those without access to a computer, but it seems as though it has everything to offer: it would prevent fraud, generate however many receipts you want to create a cross-check, be fast to tabulate, and be convenient for people who can't get around easily. We could have a week during which to submit. The speakers on the show point out that most advances in American voting - such as the absentee ballot, introduced during the Civil War - are first implemented for people serving in the military. Perhaps soon we'll all be submitting an e-ballot as many of them do now. It could only be an improvement over this BS about fighting over poll hours and locations and ID.

Email voting sounds good in theory Miko but I work with tech people that struggle with the concept of captchas. How do you ensure that only the authorized voter is voting and not some malware that is intercepting outgoing SMTP traffic?

I think HTTPS is probably more doable but you'd still need to make sure people don't forget their password or use password123, etc.

Here's a fantastic wingnut rant from Facebook that got posted today. I can assure you it is not satire - this guy posts stuff like this all the time. Remember: if you don't vote, you're letting people like this decide the election.
Before You Vote... Let Me Explain This To You... Up Until 1871 We Had A Constitutional Republic Called The United States (Notice Spelling) Representing And Represented By We The People... BUT In 1871 They Moved Our Capital From Pennsylvania (A State In Union And Leaving Us Without A Government) To Washington DC (A Foreign District) And Formed A Corporation Called The UNITED STATES (Notice Spelling ALL CAPS) Declaring To Be The Government (And Threw Our Constitution Out The Window And Starting Writing Laws To Which We Were To Follow Of Their Own Not The Unalienable Rights Our Constitution Gave Us) And Was To Only Govern In Washington DC For 1 Year But Was Never Reversed! As Time Went By Alot Of Things Happened But Then In 1913 The Corporation SOLD The Power Of Coining And Regulating Money Away From The Congress To ANOTHER Corporation We Know As The Federal Reserve (Unconstitutional). A Few More Years Went By And In 1933 They Took YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE And Formed A Corporation Around Your Name To Back The Loans From The Central Banks (Commonly Referred To As A STRAWMAN Look It Up) And Made Adhesion Contracts For That Corporation To Tie You Into Their Jurisdiction Such As Drivers License, Social Security Cards, Checking Accounts, Federal Reserve Notes (Money), Mortgages, Anything With Title (Look At Them All They Are In CAPS Which Denotes Corporation Gramatically) Then In 1944 The Corporation Took All Of Its Assets (Building, Strawmen, Titles, EVERYTHING They Owned) And Deeded It To The International Monetary Fund ANOTHER Foreign Corporation (IMF Brenton Woods Act Of 1944 For Research) Soooo If You Think Your Vote Counts Think Again Because The Government Is A Corporation Run By A Foreign Corporation!!! Example: If McDonalds Buys Burger King Who Is Gonna Control??? Think About It!!! Who Do You REALLY Thinks Calls The Shots??? NOT WE THE PEOPLE!!! The Corporation Owns You, Everything You THINK You Own, Your Children, EVERYTHING!!! So In Closing No Matter Who You Vote For Obama, Romney, Paul, Johnson, ANYONE They Will Not Answer To You Because The IMF Is Still Gonna Call The Shots And They Are After One Thing And One Thing Only ONE WORLD ORDER It Doesnt Matter What Person We Elect He/She Will Be Part Of Carrying Out The Master Plan!!! Any Questions???

I voted weeks ago (woohoo 100% mail-in voting! They're expecting over 80% turnout in my state!) in a state that Silver has as a 100% obama victory, but we have some really important downticket races. The race for Governor is really important this time around. But what will truly just break my heart is if we reject R-74, the vote to retain our state's (brand-new, suspended until the election) policy of extending the protections of marriage to all couples. As I said on Facebook, the only thing that threatens my marriage is the idea that the government gets more of a say about whom I marry than I do.

I wish I could say that I'll just be peaceably ignoring the whole thing, secure in my knowledge that I've done what I can, but the reality is that I'll be relentlessly refreshing this page and many others all day long, breathing into a paper bag and coming up with snarky election-themed cocktails.

No shit. I told this story a while back, but one of my oldest friends and musical mentors is a self-described "hillbilly redneck" hunter, country musician, and tractor mechanic in the Arkansas Ozarks who voted for Obama in 2008 and will do so again. 

This is a guy who left *Texas* in the late 1990s (where I had played in his band for several years) because it was getting too cosmopolitan for him. He lives so far off the grid we hunt deer from his back porch and you need to rent an SUV to make it to his house on the 5 miles of dirt road it takes to get there. 

For one reason: Bush the Crusader sent his kid to Iraq and fucked him up for life. 

I hope there are many more of these guys than anyone suspected. I never hear stories like his in the media, but I know they are out there.

Romney Death Rally:
What is Kali Ma? Staffers at #RomneyDeathRally won't explain anything. Chanting grows louder. Dogs are howling. My kids just want to go home 

One by one the stars are winking out, while the dark fires in Mitt Romney's eyes burn ever brighter. The end is nigh. 

Trump's hairpiece grows. It seethes. It demands. We comply. Our birth certificates. Our school transcripts. Our souls. 

"I can be slain by no man," Romney bellows, breath of rot and sulfur. Hillary Clinton raises her sword. "I am no man!" 

The sun is out yet no light shines. A locomotive bourne of sinew and flesh belches sulfer. The Cain train has arrived. 

Palin, frothing from her maw, screams "I CAN SEE R'LYEH FROM MY BACKYARD!" 

Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul have now disrobed. Upon one chest is "laissez." Upon the other, "faire." Their bodies merge. 

"I will bring Reagan back to America!" Mitt opens his shirt to reveal the face of Reagan sewn to his belly. Its eyes open.

This was my voting experience in Savannah, GA:

The polling place was a Lutheran church. First you had to check-in, then get in line. Since the actual line to vote snaked outside, those in the line were constantly reminding new comers to go check-in.

Check-in involved filling out a short form with your name, address and signature, which was then checked by a poll worker, to make sure the name and addresses matched. Then you took said form and got in the big line to actually vote.

But, since the line to vote actually snaked past the check-in table, I just got in line and filled out the form when I passed the table. Efficiency is good.

Anyway, once in line, I was sandwiched between a guy talking on his phone and a family taking their 11 year old daughter with them to vote. The family was sweet, as they educated their daughter for what was clearly the nth time on the importance of voting and women's rights. The girl was nice , though a bit bored at times, which was understandable. But she had an her cell phone with a few games to keep her occupied when the adults would not shut up.

Once the line was inside the voting place, the layout of the voting process was a bit clearer. The line we were in wasn't the exact line to vote, there was a final check in, where your Georgia driver's license or ID card was scanned and checked against a database to make sure you were...something. I'm assuming it was that you were at the right polling place and legally able to vote. 

While waiting to get to his point, the line passed a poll watcher who was, well, watching the room. There was sign at the entrance to the polling station which said talking or texting was forbidden once you were inside. In conversation with the watcher, she said she didn't care whether people were texting or talking, just if they were bothering other people. Fair enough.

Just before I was about to be checked in for the second time, the computer system on the voter databases seemed to go down. There was that familiar sign of people checking computer connections, then workers called out to the lead poll watcher that the system was down. She asked if they had checked the connections, they replied that they had and she implored them to check again, all of them. They did, including the cable leading to the wall and verified everything was alright. 

Then the lead poll watcher came over and did something and figured out that it wasn't the system, just a single computer. Since there were only two computers, that meant the line could continue, just at a slower pace.

When I reached this check point, I handed over the form I had filled out, along with driver's license. The poll watcher marked off a something on my form, picked up a yellow ballot card and handed it and my license to me. 

Then I went and cheerfully voted for socialist kenyan who is stealing our freedoms. When done, I turned the ballot card back in, got my sticker and left. All of this took about 30-40 minutes. This particular process would have been much quicker if there had been more computers at the final check out, that seemed to be the big bottle neck, ever before one computer started acting up. There were 5 actual polling booths and at times, only 1 or 2 were being used, due to the final check-in being slow. That might have been do to what I assume the voter database being overwhelmed with the entire county dialing in.

A bartender friend of mine suggested something drinkable, which is an Aviation made with curacao instead of creme de violette. That would be gin, maraschino, and blue curacao.

From my other spitballing with her, a Green Party is absinthe, St. Germain, and soda: a bunch of things that all sound good in theory, but in practice combine to form something kind of unsettling. A Libertarian Party is moonshine and goldschlager; halfway through the party, you switch the moonshine for Sterno, and anyone who didn't bring a gas chromatograph to verify the composition of their drink should have planned better. A Democratic Party is vodka and soda; no lime, color, flavor, or substance, but at least it doesn't have Sterno in it. And a GOP is just an Old Fashioned with a different name.

After I gave him shit for being undecided, we talked for about 20 minutes about our lives, families, and hopes. I think he'll vote Obama, but you never know.

And at 8:30, 450 people had voted already, assuming the counter on the ballot reader was correct.

Voted in Hendersonville, NC, about 7:30 am. No line. 8 voting machines, less than 8 people there when I got there. Went to the table marked "A-L", gave the nice old lady with the big binder (full of women AND men!) my name. She flipped through, found it, asked me to confirm my address. No ID necessary. Voted, verified my selection on the paper spool behind the little window on the machine. Did not get a sticker. Thought about taking one from the "kids vote!" table set up in the corner, but decided against it. Went to work.

That's how it's been every year I've voted here (since 2004). In 2010 I was literally the only non poll worker there when I walked in. I don't know if Hendersonville has low voter turnout, or people just vote later in the day, or what. There are a lot more names in those binders than you'd think, being there.

Sales people hate the information age. National polls, over land lines? Please! I install landlines for a living. These people are old, OLD, saving by bundling(so the never use it), on the bracelet, or no cell service. Even if the Damien wins, they won't make it another election. I see young adults more concerned with the direction we are going then I ever was as that age. So this is like Star Wars, only we have greater numbers, and a constitution, and information.

Mine didn't move, as it turns out, but a number of others in town did - several of our schools don't have power yet. I think my sister is voting by email. 

When I get out of work tonight, I shall settle in for the night with snacks and the TV and my spreadsheet. Really wish I didn't have work today, kind of, but I just went back yesterday after an unexpected week off, so I can't really complain too much.

I voted against Akin. I want a sticker!

I came home the other day and my neighbor had placed an Akin sign in their yard. I said 'screw that' and went and acquired a whole slew of signs for various democrats (7 in all.) Later that day, I see my neighbor pull into his driveway, look over at my yard, shake his head and back out. He came back 45 minutes later with 3 Romney signs.

Did we see the actual polling place? What if that's the front entrance to a church, and 150 m down the hall is the auditorium?

Depends entirely on the state law. Here it is 75' from the entrance to the building.

It has been almost 20 years since I handed out how to vote gumpf, but here we count the polling location as any building within which the booths sit. It seems to work for us, with your compulsory voting on randomly decided Saturdays.

The only people I can recall within voting locations are electoral commission workers, and hands-off scruitineers.

Why? When our country's elected leader has a massive amount of sway in world matters,...

It's condescending because we know this already.

Also because it implies that we have the power to control or sway other people's votes. We just don't. I know it makes me feel impotent, and I'm sure that's true for others, but I've been on a long slow process of recgonizing that America does get the government it wants. I wish we were consistently better, but the demons of our national history and character can't be just wished or willed away. It takes work. We're doing it, a lot of us, but we're met with equally passionate work on the part of those whose vision for this nation is significantly different, and they have just as legitimate a right to push for it, no matter how much I, we, you deplore it.

I was a little surprised to learn that only 27 states + Washington DC allow no-excuse voting by mail. I could never figure out why people would stand in line to vote when they could just mail it in, but I suppose that's because I've always lived in states where that's an option.


Because mail ballots are only a viable solution for people who will be unavailable our out of town. It is extremely important to encourage people who can vote in-person to do so because there's no chain of custody for absentee ballots. No monitoring of the casting of the ballot to guard against intimidation. The only solution to long lines is more capacity at polling places, not tossing away the vital protections a carefully monitored and conducted polling place has.

Additionally, there are myriad ways to toss an absentee ballot that can't occur in-person. Stringent signature verification standards for example, and there is no machine that checks for over-votes like an optical scanner at an actual polling place.

Who do you trust, a volunteer poll worker monitored by observers from both parties in a neutral space, or ballots scattered to the winds where voters might be intimidated into signing or watched while casting?

I voted absentee/grace period last week (forgot to change my address within a month of the election, whoops). One of the big foreseeable problems with mailing an absentee ballot is postage, e.g. nowhere on the envelope or in the literature have they denoted the cost to mail the dang thing. Imagining a lot of poor folks are going to get their ballots with red post office stamps all over them this week, unless USPS makes an exception though the govt certainly isn't doing them any favors.

No, not everywhere: look here for a list of states offering election-day or "same-day" registration --- and North Dakota has no registration requirement at all!

If you have not registered yet, you may still be eligible to vote today. 

And it's typically quick and easy. Heck, some unregistered voters in line with me this morning got registered, handed a ballot, and led to a booth in the brief time I was still standing in line. (And I don't begrudge them the line-jump AT ALL: if its their first time, let's make it as quick and pleasant as possible so they'll come back next time!)

I'm really kicking myself about something now. 

I'm not an American, but I live here and definitely want Obama to win. A few weeks ago I was talking to one of my fellow TAs for a class at my grad school. He's a black guy, from Florida, an undergrad. Even though I can't vote here, I'm a political junkie and I said something about the election coming up. Only to find out that this super nice, funny guy said he doesn't follow politics at all and wasn't going to vote as he didn't know anything about the two candidates. I mentally face-palmed and then briefly debated talking to him about this but eventually decided that since Florida looked pretty safe for Obama at the time and it wasn't really my place to argue with him about it, that I should just keep silent. If it does come down to a handful of votes in Florida, I'm going to be kicking myself for a while :(

Haven't voted yet, and have already decided on the presidential and senate races.

I always try to consider at least ONE Green Party Candidate, so I looked at the House race. It's a pretty solid lock for the Dems - Hakeem Jeffries has introduced a lot of bills I support, but he also supported the Atlantic Yards/Barclay Center behemoth (pre-rusted for your convenience), so I got issues with that.

And then I got all excited when I saw the Green Party candidate was the No-Impact Man. And then my confidence was dashed when I saw that, on the front page of his blog right now, he has mis-spelled the word "Hurricane".

I have no idea.

Held my nose and did my part to protect Ohio and thus the nation.

This is also my first election as a home owner, so going down the list of tax levies was like grocery shopping with my wife. Watching one thing after another go in the basket and feeling more and more uncomfortable as the cost totaled up. I'm putting my money where my mouth is, though, and voted to support my public services. I don't think the school levy has a good chance, though. They're asking for five times as much as any other tax issue and when that one rang up even I was given pause. I was also amused how the wording in the school levy issue included GIANT EMERGENCY OH MY GOD VOTE YES OR WE WILL DIE oversize text.

So, held my nose for president and did the deed, voted myself some higher taxes, mostly gave the D's support where contested and laughed at Joe the Plumber.

And then I had pie.

Voted at 6:45 this morning, number 18 in the line for people in my state senator's area at that polling place. No line, took all of 5 minutes. 

I miss voting on important things and I really miss voter guides where each candidate writes a small bit about themselves (like they have in OR). Several of the judges were listed as being Republican, Democrat and Conservative, so I voted for the guys from the Working Families Party. Not that I think they'll win. But it's Brooklyn, so all I'm doing is adding to vote totals. 

The fact that New York does not have early voting blows my mind. I don't really understand why.

As for those who object to voting by mail, you can do what I did when I was in Oregon- fill out the ballot and then drop it off at the library in the week leading up to the election. I assume most places have drop off spots.

I'm hopeful, but worried and scared. On the other hand, if Obamam wins, I'm expecting street parties in New York again. If Romney wins, well, I've got two bottles of good single malt and I'm buying beer to watch the election with the roommates.

Because mail ballots are only a viable solution for people who will be unavailable our out of town. 

Tell that to the residents of Oregon and Washington, where all voting is done by mail, and where coincidentally the voter turnout rates happen to be 8.5% and 4.6% higher (resp.) than the national average.

Additionally, there are myriad ways to toss an absentee ballot that can't occur in-person. Stringent signature verification standards for example, and there is no machine that checks for over-votes like an optical scanner at an actual polling place.

That's just nonsense. For one thing, mail tampering is already a serious crime, and there are established systems to enforce it. In Washington there have been 15 million ballots cast by mail since 2000 and only nine convictions of voter fraud. 9/15,000,000 are pretty good odds, and the increased turnout surely makes up for the infinitesimal risk increase. Besides, you can track your ballot online and verify that it has been counted. Every signature is most certainly verified, and they feed the ballots into the same optical scanners that in-person voters use.

My wife and I voted in Cary, NC at about 7:30 am. Very busy but the enthusiastic poll workers were running a tight ship. I was number 155 at that station. We were going to vote Saturday but a friend said it was a madhouse so we waited.

Right after that we went to my kid's second grade parent-teacher conference and saw their hallway election display with post-its where the kids had done a mock election. Obama had about 75% of the vote. Yay kids!

Good morning from Massachusetts (which I flew into last night so I could go to my boyfriend's election party tonight - I voted in-person absentee in Virginia a couple weeks ago)! My dad reported that he was around #75 in line at 6:10 this morning in Alexandria, VA, all of my Northern Virginia friends are posting pics on Facebook of big lines, and my mom reported a loooooong line around 10 am in Dayton, OH. My boyfriend had only about a 5 minute wait here in Cambridge (Harvard GSD polling place, around 9:30 am) though. I am about to die of nervousness and am probably going to head out to volunteer for Elizabeth Warren in a few minutes here so that I can do something other than read blogs and have panic attacks all day. 

Also, here's a bit of inspiration from a friend who is currently backpacking in Peru:
"Yo. I spent $180 to have my ballot shipped to a small town in the Peruvian Andes, never got it, printed off an emergency ballot online one week ago, traveled some five hours to get to Cuzco, and spent another 275 soles (~$100) to three-day ship it back to Virginia. Don't tell me you can't take an hour off today to go vote."

Happy Election Day, everybody!

Yeah you know little C's treatment would have cost 500,000 dollars if we lived in the states, and she would have a preexisting condition from the age of 20 months. That would have caused us financial ruin and made her a slave to whatever health care she could get. 

As it is, We're out of pocket about a thousand bucks over two years of treatment as of next week, and we're currently siting on a ferry to the hospital. Government health care is paying for the ferry too. 

C. is a dual USA Canada citizen so it's not just theory. If she is ever to live in the USA she has to have something like obamacare. It's that simple.

I voted at 8:45 this morning. I was voter #118. I wore my USA Flag pin (just like all of the politicians) and my Big Gay Rainbow Scarf. It is pouring rain and about 35 degrees outside.

My polling place is literally 20 feet from my front door. There was no line, but I live in a town of 2,000 so that wasn't a surprise. The octogenarian election judge showed me how to fill out the ballot by hovering his pen over the Romney/Ryan oval and saying "You fill in the oval completely." I thanked him, went into the little booth, voted with my conscience, got my sticker and was on my merry way.

Now I wait.

You don't need early voting or voting by mail to have a high turnout rate. Minnesota frequently leads the nation and we don't have either except for people who are going to be out of the district on election day. 

It would, theoretically, be easier to sell your vote with a vote by mail system.

I early voted here in Maryland, and the turnout was heavy. On the way to work this morning I passed several polling places, and turnout looks to be very good today, too. I'm not sure if that just correlates with voting-on-the-way-to-work or what. There are several important downballot issues here, including Marriage Equality and the Maryland DREAM Act. I did my part for the cause, but my sticker fell off my jacket, so I feel a little empty inside.

Line in my city ward had about a 20-30 minute wait early this morning; the state is projected to have over 70% voter turnout for this election. A trivial but unsettling thing happened to me; my name was nowhere to be found in the voter registry book. The official (who happened to be a close neighbor) even checked the archive of purged voter names, and nothing. Why is this unsettling? I've been voting in this city for 20 years now. Thank gods for same day registration; all of this took longer than I'd allotted time for, but I was able to vote. No answer as to why or how my name came to be dropped, though.

And now I'll be as nervous as a cat all day. I am still baffled (and frankly more than a little embarrassed in front of the rest of the world) that this presidential race is even close. Tonight, my TV will get its standard turn-on-every-four-years run.

Well, and worse, to my mind, they try to have it both ways. The talk about the "oversampling" of Democratic voters this cycle really only makes sense if you ignore the going vogue among Republican voters calling themselves "Independent." You can't both have the same number of Republicans you used to have, and have substantially more Independents. It's a very weird kind of subterfuge.

On the bright side, I'm going to an election-result-viewing party at the US embassy in Nairobi at like 5am tomorrow. So that's kinda cool. My first ever party at an embassy!

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Americans in Kenya seem to overwhelmingly favor the candidate from Nyanza province.

Chatted with the guy behind me about how Tennessee bans phones in polling places because damn it, if being bored standing in line was good enough for the founding fathers it's good enough for us. As is my usual habit I wrote in my partner's name against anyone running unopposed. Sticker acquired, mission accomplished.

I noted with interest that on our ballot we had candidates from the newly-formed Descendents of American Slaves party. Wish I'd known more about them before I voted. While I'm a little discomfited by what I perceive as their lack of separation of church and state, I find myself intrigued by their ideas.

Line *looked* reasonable, so we went to vote. Unfortunately, it was one of those super snaky lines that masked its true horror. Hour and a half.

Which would have been marginally less, but we accidentally got in the wrong section of the line to deposit the ballot and someone complained to te election official that my tot and I were cutting in line. Yes. My tot who had been in line for over an hour already and was now late for nap and showing it. But apparently, holding toddlers to the rules was very important to somebody.

There are a lot of people that would actually like the US to be less the upholder of the free world and all.

Yeah. Was largely joking. But the point is that people aren't condescending, they're responding to US power. People don't say "don't disappoint us" 'cause they think that the US electorate is stupid, they say it because it profoundly matters to them whether it is. You might not like being the most powerful country in the world, but you are. It has its disadvantages, but there are also disadvantages that will emerge as that position wanes.

So far all the right places from which MeFites report are reporting light turnout, and all the right places are reporting heavy turnout. For example, it's to the Dem's benefit if there is low turnout almost anywhere but an urban neighborhood in Missouri. Akin's only hope is a wave of last minute motivated Romney supporters going to the polls even though the presidency appears uncontested there.

In all seriousness, fuck Mitt Romney and everyone behind him that thought they could buy an election and win on hate. I am reminded of a line from Bliss (the film based on the novel by Peter Carey) that basically goes "I curse you all for all eternity and without exception". 

This is the guy I voted for in 2008, and this is the guy I voted for 2 weeks ago with tears in my eyes because I knew it would be a long time until my next opportunity to vote for someone I value and respect. 

That being said, this is still my national anthem. For everyone else sitting in their comfortable lives with their smug selves who don't really know what it means to struggle and to suffer, fuck them too. For everyone hungry kid in this country, for every person with no place to live or a hellhole they try to call home, for everyone with addictions they can't get help for, for everyone with no real chance to pull themselves out of the ditch, for every person looked over for even the shittiest of jobs because they're the wrong color/age/gender, for every person that can't get lifesaving medical treatment or has had to file bankruptcy because they *could* get it, for everyone who knows first hand just how fucked things really are in this country, I tried to vote for the guy I pray can turn the dial at least a degree or two in the right direction.

Went to my Pittsburgh-area polling place with my wife this morning. Was asked to show a photo ID, declined, and was told "well you don't need it this time but you will next time", to which I said "yeah, we'll see about that."

Got to the electronic voting machine, same style as the one shown earlier in the thread with the touchscreen calibration problems. No such problems with mine, but the poll workers did have problems getting my machine (which had just been used seconds earlier by another voter) to come up with the initial screen. They plugged a large hard-token type thing into it to get it to initialize, and some sort of white boot screen came up. The one worker asked the other one if it had already recorded a blank vote, and the other guy said "no, I don't think it does that until the last screen." Comforting!

Eventually the main screen came up, I made my selections, and said a silent prayer (our polling place is a Lutheran church) that my vote actually gets counted.

The main argument against Question 7, and it's a good argument, is that there's absolutely no guarantee that the school system will see a single dime (in the words of the state Comptroller, no less) of the promised income. Also, many people find it peculiar that the casino owners haven't even built all the casinos they said they'd build the last time we did something like this, so why should we give them even more money now? Add to that any normal objections to casinos or gambling, and you have a solid opposition bloc. I voted against, for what it's worth, because I trust the Comptroller more than big business.

There are a few arguments: #1 - the money will not go into education as promised - it's just another empty promise; #2 - taxpayers should not subsidize an expensive private business - another example of giving big tax breaks/money to the rich owners; #3 - the folks who will build the casino likely will not be Maryland residents, so the promise of jobs is not exactly accurate.

In suburban Detroit. Recently moved to Richie Rich lake-property /old conservative white folk country. (Where people drive trucks with bumper stickers reading: “My other auto is a Glock 9mm.” And lots of R-Money signs are blighting my beautiful scenic roads.) 

All my local govt. officials are Rs, and there’s very gerrymandered state/national districts. My state rep is a tea party nutter, married to another elected TP guy. And my US Congressional district is the now infamous MI-11, former job of Thaddeus McCotter.

I’m trying to be hopeful the Dem candidate will take the latter post, but probably the crazy Repub (is that redundant at this point?) will win. And I’m sure TP lady will be reelected. So my goal is to stay somewhat active in politics, and get one/both the hell out of office next time.

Yesterday I voted absentee ballot and then made a token GOTV effort, driving my poor old car around, trying to drop off lit to homes that I think were union people. (Who probably didn’t need the reinforcement at this point!)

I think the argument against it is basically "don't vote for it because of education" which is probably right. The gambling for education thing is generally a ruse since no amount of gambling revenue keeps the state legislature from appropriating less to education to account for gambling revenue. 

I also grew up in North Carolina back when we didn't have a lotto and was raised to believe that lottos were an evil Yankee invention, like toll roads, that should be opposed at all costs. I'm not anti-gambling (I am anti-state run lottery), but I still hate the gambling revenue for education argument.

you can also make calls to get out the vote by going to "certain candidate" webpages. they give you all of the information online. i have friends working phones all day and MANY have talked to people who were unsure of where to vote or who needed some support. could be worth it to take your lunch hour to help with GOTV.

I like to vote without showing any ID, just because I can. Today the nice poll worker looked at me standing before her, empty handed, and sighed just a litt bit. 
"It's a little easier if we have something with your name on it." Then she looked up my name, crossed it off, had me sign, and sent me on down the line to get my ballot. 
I should really be nicer to my poll workers.

The MD gambling expansion referendum would send money to education, but it is likely to be offset by cuts to education funding from other sources. My boss wrote a policy brief about it (full disclosure, I edited it, and yes I know our website sucks. I'm a policy analyst, not a web designer, no matter what my boss thinks).

Voted this morning in Columbus in a pretty diverse neighborhood heavily trafficked by graduate students. Lines were disconcertingly short and they ran out of stickers, but the mean guy who made me file a provisional ballot in 2010 wasn't working the polls this year, and I got flirted with by an enormous man passing out sample ballots for Democrats. My only other duties today are to go teach about the interbreeding between humans and Neandertals, and maybe get into an argument with the Alliance of Ohio Christian Voters who have been passing out flyers on the Oval for the past couple of weeks about how contraception coverage is the same thing as religious oppression. Cross your fingers, drink some beer, and eat a cookie. Hooray USA!

anya32: "There are a few arguments: #1 - the money will not go into education as promised - it's just another empty promise; #2 - taxpayers should not subsidize an expensive private business - another example of giving big tax breaks/money to the rich owners; #3 - the folks who will build the casino likely will not be Maryland residents, so the promise of jobs is not exactly accurate."

So, basically the argument against it is that the legislature does a bad or inconsistent job of appropriating money from the general fund?

I fail to see how preventing gambling expansion would make this any worse. The legislature would just have less money in the budget to work with. How exactly does that help education?

I'm certainly sympathetic to Argument #2, although I'm not quite sure how gambling is being subsidized any more than anything else in National Harbor has been. Wouldn't the casinos be a large and reliable revenue stream for the state? Sounds more like an investment than a subsidy (as opposed to, say, sports stadia, which rarely recoup their initial investment). 

Argument #3 makes less sense. Why exactly should we care about which one-percenters own the casino? They'd be paying taxes in Maryland, and the workers at the casino would presumably mostly be living in the state.

MA 5-2, voted in the shadow of Fenway Park. Four people in line, about 20 voting. Reasonable turn-out for 11 AM. Voted "yes" on all three ballot questions, plus there was a surprise 4th question, which was a non-binding advisory question on how to balance the budge. 

I was interviewed by a reporter on my way out. He was specifically interested in Brown/Warren. I told him I voted against Brown because he acted like a dick during the campaign (he asked me to re-state it). But I probably won't get published anyways, as the reporter was from the Boston Herald, and they love Scott Brown.

I voted in a rec center in the projects near where I live and there is a big sign outside that says you can't get in the building without ID. I thought this was for voting so got mine out, but then of course didn't need any ID to vote, though there was a thing that matched my signature. The ID sign was probably just for the regular rec center use. 

It's just really frustrating, how many people maybe didn't come in because they didn't have ID, thinking it was for the voting.

I won't be surprised if the "Nos" prevail just because most people will have no idea what the question is asking. (Not sure that better notice solves that problem, sadly.) I don't think that getting ballot questions in under the wire does anyone any favors.

I voted two weeks ago and grabbed two I Voted stickers, one for that day and one to wear today. My state is one of those that passed an onerous voter ID law, presumably in an effort to disenfranchise the poor, working-class and elderly. There was some commentary about the fact that my state's ID law allows voters to use handgun carry permits, which was seen as a way to re-enfranchise conservative voters.

When I showed up at the county rec center to vote, I showed my carry permit and then voted for Obama. Take THAT, Republican Voter Suppression Machine!

I did not vote a straight Democratic ticket, though, because this this clown is our Democratic nominee for Senate. I voted for Martin Pleasant, Green Party, instead.

Got to the electronic voting machine, same style as the one shown earlier in the thread with the touchscreen calibration problems. No such problems with mine, but the poll workers did have problems getting my machine (which had just been used seconds earlier by another voter) to come up with the initial screen. They plugged a large hard-token type thing into it to get it to initialize, and some sort of white boot screen came up. The one worker asked the other one if it had already recorded a blank vote, and the other guy said "no, I don't think it does that until the last screen." Comforting!

Yeah, this is what i had (rural Western PA). I didn't have any problems, except it took me a while to realize the big red flashing "vote" button was what you needed to push to finish the vote. 

This is the first election where I've felt my vote won't be counted.

I voted, in MA. You just give the poll worker your street address, they look it up in their big book, ask you what your name is, and if they match you're good to go. No ID or anything needs to be shown. And the ballot is paper, and you get to feed it into a neato giant scanner thingy. The whole country should be doing this. It's incredibly easy to understand, and it leaves a paper trail.

Voting Machine in Pennsylvania Isn’t Accepting Votes for Obama

"...video one Pennsylvania voter captured of an electronic voting machine refusing to accept a vote for President Obama, instead repeatedly selecting "MITT ROMNEY" for President when the voter clearly intended to vote for Barack Obama. 

This glitch is even more chilling when you consider the fact that Pennsylvania's governor, Republican Tom Corbett, told attendees at a Mitt Romney rally on Sunday that he was confident the state's electoral votes would go to Governor Romney, despite the fact that Obama's got a relatively safe lead in most state polls."

The GOP is going to have to rethink itself.

I would love to believe that this is the case, but I fear that at least some of them will double down. 

It will be up to liberals in America not to sacrifice the momentum and organisation that they have built up in the course of the campaign. Liberalism in America needs to be evangelised and grown, almost like a religion, during the times when a specific liberal president is not running for office. Unless liberal candidates can be supported by strong liberal institutions, they will be less likely to get into office and less likely to keep their promises when they do. 

Remember how in 2008 the Republican party - despite being for years dominated by a powerful religious voting block - was quick to accuse Democrats of forming an "Obama Cult"? 

In my experience, Republicans always talk, quite openly, about what they fear - they do it by accusing their enemies of doing whatever it is they are most afraid of, in the hope that their enemies will get embarrassed and disclaim it. In this case, Republicans were clearly terrified of the idea of a large, lasting liberal community with the integrity, sociability and vigor of a religion (but with a much more open-minded social agenda). 

So I guess what I'm saying, in a long-winded way, is that I hope Americans who can, vote today - but that after today is over and the time comes to move forward, the liberal side of the aisle doesn't make the mistake of 2008 and demobilise. Win or lose, they have to keep spreading the good word.

Most people who are homeless have an address that they use, because you need one for so many documents and resources. It may be a shelter at which they sometimes stay, an aid agency, or a relative or friend's house,a PO box or a Mailboxes Etc. box. 

If your house is gone (like in the storm) you still have that as a legal address.

My hypothesis is that he remains in-state because here he's King of The Republicans (what few we have anyway) and that if he based his operations somewhere else he'd have to deal with party officials who wield considerably more influence than he does.

The partisan Republican pundits aren't going to say that Romney was a bad candidate until after the election results are tallied and Democratic pundits have no incentive to reduce voter turnout when many lower ticket races are still definitely in doubt.

Of course shitheads like Dick Morris won't own up to their bloviating nonsense after the election, they'll just transfer the blame to Democratic Chicago style shenanigans rather than put forth the idea that the Republican party needs to transform itself unless it wants to be a regional opposition party.

Old school Republicans from the Northeast made that transformation in order to remain relevant in national elections and now the new breed of southern social conservative Republicans are going to have to come to some hard decisions about the type of party they want to present to the electorate.

Sure, if Plutocrat Romney is revealed as the lucky winner, he'll probably give a long harangue about how European countries must join America in the quest to bomb the shit out of Iran, but that's about it.

Obama is popular in Europe the rest of the world because he doesn't come across as being a stereotypical American, that's really all there is to it.

Should I take the absence of a Presidential prediction in this comment as a sign to FREAK OUT about Virginia? Because that seems to be what I'm doing today, strangely. Seeking out information that points to an Obama defeat, since everyone else seems so confident.

Kaine is running ahead of Obama, but not by too much. If Ironmouth's source is solid, then being confident now is a good sign.

BTW I saw some tweets a couple hours ago from a reporter who's been following the Obama campaign since early 2007 and who claims he's familiar with their body language and mannerisms, and he thought they looked pretty confident and excited. It's not much to go on, but it makes me feel just a little bit better.

What now? Or what about us who are there already?

Well, I think in the issues he identified before talking about the consumer goods - full federal funding for elections, keeping corporate money out of it, etc. Occupy in its earliest days had a winning formula of talking not about policital races but about commonalities - economic inequality and policies favoring the kind of growth most people really don't approve of ideologically. I think keeping and building focus around civic issues of common interest regardless of party is a wise move for revolutionaries. Meanwhile, the people in office make the policies we live under, so it makes sense to express preferences - if not ideals - there, where they are happening now. 

Too many people, I think, imagine the Presidential vote as their only opportunity for protest or alternative political visions. But that's silly. Change doesn't start there - it starts on the ground, in grassroots movements, local coalitions, municipal and state committees, offices, and policies.I don't understand why more of my radical friends don't engage with the system in places where the system is actually built, but only at the very last domino, where it's really too little too late to achieve more idealistic goals.

Now you've got me feeling guilty for going to the polls in jeans. I do usually try to dress up for civic events like town meeting. I hated being made to dress up for things as a kid, but as I get older I've come to understand that dressing up for an occasion is a way of saying, "Hey, we live in a civil society and this is my show of respect for my fellow attendees/participants."

So my wife and a friend were discussing the election during playdate a week or two ago, and my four year old son asked them what they were talking about. In trying to explain why they don't like Romney's tax and economic policies, she resorted to a metaphor about sharing: we think Romney's ideas are like giving most of the toys to just some kids, Obama's we think would be like sharing more of the toys with more of the kids who don't already have toys.

My son's takeaway interpretation of this, which he's repeated many times since and has clung to despite many attempts on my part to clarify, is that ROMNEY WANTS TO STEAL ALL THE TOYS FROM ALL THE KIDS.

Oh, hai, guise, if yr sitting around waiting and eating chocolates, feeling anxious and stuff, I have an idea.

If you're for Obama, try the following. (If you're for Romney stay home with your chocolate and anxiety.)

Take Action! 

If you are in a Battleground State, go to your local Field Office or Staging Location, grab a walk-pack, and go do some knocks! For every fourteen doors you knock, you get one new vote for the candidate. So in a two hour canvass shift you can get maybe five new votes. Florida is going to be decided by a few thousand votes. If you each get five friends to join a canvass, and we're dead even like the polls say, then that will be enough to cover the spread. We can win this. It's crunch time. You can be in control. It's in your hands.

If you're not in a battleground state, make phone calls into one. Click Here and get on board!

This is the one thing that makes me feel a little sad about voting by mail or electronically. Going to the polling place and seeing your neighbors and fellow citizens gather the purpose of representation gives me this little "civic glow," the same thing I feel making donations or giving blood. It's one of the small rituals that still keeps some of us bound together. A little sorry that our trend toward doing everything separately via devices would cut a little more into that.

Really, how will the president (elect) make any different to Europe? That place has plenty of problems of its own without getting into America's messes. Look to Norway and Sweden, I guess.

If you're for Obama, try the following. (If you're for Romney stay home with your chocolate and anxiety.) ... 

What if you're for Jill Stein and you have to work all day then pick up the kids after school and make dinner and then do the dishes, make lunch for tomorrow, and balance the budget?

My second vote is for Stein, but my first vote is making dinner on time and getting the kids to sleep. If the polling line is longer than an hour, I'm not gonna be able to do it. Sure, I should have voted early, or absentee. I should do a lot of things. Sorry, America, you'll have to live without my worthless opinion again.

I just found the article by the guy I mentioned upthread who was talking about Obama's campaign team and how confident they were (emphasis mine):
The Obama campaign's confidence extends well beyond Pennsylvania. In conversations with an array of top advisers this morning, a clear picture emerged that Chicago believes it has Nevada, Iowa, Wisconsin, and New Hampshire more or less in the bag; that it feels nearly as certain of carrying Ohio; and that Obama is just a tad ahead in Virginia. As for Colorado and Florida, Team Obama believes they are both too close to call, but thinks they could well win both; they are forthrightly pessimistic only about North Carolina among the nine battlegrounds. This could all just be spin, of course — or they could simply be proven wrong. But having known and reported on these people for a solid six years now, my sense of their tone and body language is that their self-assurance is for real.

QUESTION

Ok, so my girlfriend and I moved last year and just updated our voter registration a couple of weeks ago. We both got cards, and I checked the Chicago Board of Elections site when we did and found both of our names on there and our proper polling place, which is right around the corner from our apartment. 

We both have bills, etc. showing our proper address (my driver's license has an old address and hers is from out of state), BUT I've just been told by my coworker that they redistricted Chicago and the huge lines we're seeing are largely due to the voter rolls not being properly updated, so I wanted to print out the page from the Board of Elections site showing our polling place, but it's down, and apparently has been for two days. -_-

So, the question is, if they try to deny me a ballot (going after work, a bit less than two hours before they close), is there anything I can do, materially, to make sure I get to vote today?

If you need help getting to a polling place, or even general storm assistance, feel free to call..."

If somebody wants to proclaim who they voted for, and where they voted at, I don't see how anybody in the govt can stop them. Free speech and all that. The prohibition on exit polling today in the media is I believe, a self-imposed thing to make sure the media doesn't unduly influence the election by announcing results while polls are still open out west.

I'm pretty confident that Mr. Silver's analysis of the correlation between polls and outcomes is good. The question is if there's other factors in play that could make a disconnect between historical polls and outcomes. 

The obvious thing to point to is vote suppression/tampering shenanigans. They're not exactly new, but there are some new twists this year, and I think the GOP may even be desperate enough to push the envelope.

Aside from voting for people it felt really good to vote for assisted suicide and medical marijuana. It almost felt like common sense and science was winning out against emotion and religious agenda.

I totally agree! After reading through the 4 questions I thought "well these are at least some cool, sensible ballot initiatives: voluntary euthanasia, medical marijuana, and repeal of Citizens United. 

There was also something about data sharing for auto mechanics which I skipped based on the advice of the Boston Globe. But still.

I'm back!
1:00pm - Backed out of my garage. Drove 1.5 miles to polling place. Voted. Drove back home.
1:17pm - Pulled into my garage.

My polling place was quiet. Two machines. One empty and waiting for me. In and done with no fuss.

Would you rather they didn't? Around here, the only requirement for being a poll worker is "show up to orientation, pass the written test, and show up for election day." The written test involves writing down what was told to you during orientation.

Washington's all-mail-in voting is demonstrably better for getting out the vote. It makes it easier to get through a long ballot while feeling confident in one's choices, because there's no pressure to get done quickly. Still, I genuinely do miss physically going to a polling station. It made me feel like I'd actually done something with my day.

I voted during what was apparently Mommy Hour. Every other person at my polling place was a toddler. The stickers, they were flying off the roll.

Walking home, I remembered the gut-churning excitement I felt on voting day four years ago. I was so full of hope that Obama would win, and so sure that there would be a giant exhale after the results were announced. There was. 

At 9 or so that night, after the election had been called, I could hear people whooping and cheering and loads of horns honking. We were so excited then. I actually got in my car and drove around the block, honking the whole way, just so I could be a part of it.

I've got some butterflies today as well. It's not the same kind of hope it was four years ago. I don't things are going to improve drastically and immediately if Obama is re-elected. But I think that if Romney were elected things would go to hell very quickly. So, yes, there's hope..

To make matters worse, I'm home in bed with a fever. Going to be a looooooong, anxious day.

Godspeed, y'all.

I should also note that in addition to calling people, you can also help people get to the polls.

Friends of mine are in Richmond now and are asking for anyone with a car to help get folks to the polls. There is still work you can do!

Jessamyn, thanks for the DailyKos article you linked to. As a citizen who simultaneously agrees with a lot of radical liberal ideas and disagrees with the extreme "vote your conscience or become the Enemy" mindset, that article did a good job expressing why that attitude frustrates me so. 

I don't think it's either cynical or pessimistic to say that human civilization is not our species' natural state. Civilization is artificial. But civilizing, on the other hand, is at the core of our very nature. What is conscious thought but the ability to seek order?

I feel that certain people whose politics are close to mine feel the exact opposite: that we should take civilization for granted, but people are savages who are ruining it for the rest of us. They conceive of an ideal society and get upset that reality doesn't match it. But why should it? The world does not exist for our convenience. That includes other people, all of whom think we should be convenient for them and not the other way around. It's just as absurdly entitled to believe that everybody ought to be loving and just as to believe that, say, gay people shouldn't be married cos God says so. Maybe even more entitled, since love and justice are so hard to obtain. 

I wish the world was getting better at a faster pace. I doubt I'll live to see the society that I wish I could live in. But except for when I'm in an especially bad mood, I don't hold others responsible for not helping to create that society for me. The fact that I can envision something better means I'm responsible for sharing my vision, piece by piece, person by person. It's up to me to help others dream for my dream. 

This doesn't stop me from hating the hate and bigotry that would deny my friends rights which they clearly deserve. Doesn't stop me from acting sometimes like the right-ness of the world I long for is so self-evident that only imbeciles would fail to think it worthwhile. But I try not to get mad at political process and compromise, weakness and corruption, setbacks and failures. The system fails to live up to my ideals, but it emerged from literally nothing not super long ago, and it's comprised of faulty human beings who don't have a perfect idea of how to deal with the vast faultiness which makes rationality and order so difficult. 

I think Obama's been a great president and I voted for him today without hesitation. I expect another great four years. Is he great by the standards of my imagined society? No: in the world of my ideals he's too moderate, too willing to compromise, too okay with drone attacks and economic injustice and a whole plethora of other wretched things. But he faced the reality of 2008's America, and in four years he's made that reality considerably better in many ways, and worse in very few. If every president I vote for could cause as much progress as Barack Obama, then I'll die loving my country. 

They probably won't, and that's okay. Maybe we'll get a chance to push real radical change sometime in the future – the world's changing quickly, so who knows? But we work with what we've got, and judge the world by what it is rather than by what we'd rather it be. One can dream of a better society without wholly rejecting the one we've got.

I wonder what would happen to election results if they actually made you write in the name of the candidate you were voting for? (Let's assume the results checking would be reasonably tolerant of typos and not immediately hijacked for partisan voter suppression). Presidential results would hopefully stay similar, but I wonder just how many of the local races would be left blank.

I was so much less crazy on Election Day in 2008. I was still in college so I could successfully distract myself with classes and holing up in the library with my wireless turned off until 6:00ish, and then the result was announced at 8:00, so I had less time to spend frantically refreshing news sites and freaking out. Now I'm at work, not busy enough, and dying of anticipation and pointless anxiety. I really, really hope it's an early night, my nerves can't take it. 

(Also, I voted by mail and checked to make sure my ballot was received by the LA County Registrar on the CA Secretary of State website. That made me feel better about my ballot not disappearing into the maw of the USPS.)

Yup.

It seems kinda near to exit polling, which in other countries is unlawful to make known before the polls have shut.

Most/all media won't report exit polls until they're closed, but doing so would be lawful in the US. Under the 1st Amendment it is very, very difficult for the government to actually stop you from disseminating truthful information or punish you for doing so after the fact.

We both have bills, etc. showing our proper address (my driver's license has an old address and hers is from out of state), BUT I've just been told by my coworker that they redistricted Chicago and the huge lines we're seeing are largely due to the voter rolls not being properly updated, so I wanted to print out the page from the Board of Elections site showing our polling place, but it's down, and apparently has been for two days. -_-

So, the question is, if they try to deny me a ballot (going after work, a bit less than two hours before they close), is there anything I can do, materially, to make sure I get to vote today?

I suspect you'll be fine. If you've got the registration card they mailed you, and you do go to the correct polling station, I think you'll be ok. Worst case, you'd fill out a provisional ballot.

Good for your poll worker. I absent-mindedly got my driver's license out too because it just felt like all the other times I've been in line for something where they would ask my name, which is uncommon and oddly difficult for people to get on the first couple of tries. The guy took my license right away and still had trouble finding me.

But now I think about voter ID and feel bad about getting my license out.

I voted, in MA. You just give the poll worker your street address, they look it up in their big book, ask you what your name is, and if they match you're good to go. No ID or anything needs to be shown. And the ballot is paper, and you get to feed it into a neato giant scanner thingy. The whole country should be doing this. It's incredibly easy to understand, and it leaves a paper trail.

Yeah, that's how we do it in my county in California. Easy, leaves a paper trail, and the final machine will not accept spoiled, overvoted or blank ballots- you have to do it again. No bubbles to fill out either, you just connect a long arrow that points to your choice by filling in the middle. It's much easier for people without fine motor skills to color in, and instantly communicates "I WANT THIS ONE". Every voter should have it this easy.

God damn CNN. I get tired of people complaining about cable news (but only because I don't watch it probably) But criminy- why don't you just ask Ryan Seacrest and Khloe Kardashian to host your coverage.

adamdschneider -- I have never, ever been asked for any id when I have provided the registration card which is what my partner also uses because he doesn't have an Illinois ID. (And if you have the whole printed sheet it came on, it should have your polling place on it.)

However, I don't know if the change might affect that. I haven't voted today yet (also had an MRI to attend oddly and we forgot our polling place had changed so it wasn't on the way as we were planning) but being a few blocks from Obama campaign HQ, I definitely feel part of the process -- with the cops and the snowplows re-directing traffic. (This post has been sitting in my text box for a while as I try to upload the pics from my phone.)

(P.S. The fact that I can spell 'Khloe Kardashian' correctly without looking it up is not something I'm proud of -- though I did have to look it up to check if I was right.)

But then states would be announced reality show style... "We have the new results from Ohio...right after this commercial break." (though I'm not unconvinced CNN and the rest wouldn't do that as is.)

Voting took an hour-fifteen this morning.

Yeah, it took me about an hour, and that has never ever happened before. I don't bother voting early any more because my election-day polling place is literally a drunken stagger across the street, and there has never been more than a five-minute wait. 

This is the first major election where people can vote at any polling place in the county, though, so the election workers' theory was that it was just an unusually popular site. I am totally hoping it turns out to be record turnout instead.

(I live in one of the bluest districts of maybe the bluest county in the state, so record turnout here would be very nice.)

Linda McMahon Gives Master Class In False Flag GOTV: "McMahon’s [R-WWE] campaign is closing out the cycle with an appeal to urban and minority voters that looks and feels much like a Democratic campaign effort."

The Republican candidate for governor in Washington (McKenna) has been doing the same thing here in Seattle, in order to confuse voters about his party affiliation and personal ideology, which is largely unfriendly to said voters. Kind of a scumbag move, really, but then Republicans just don't feel any shame.

I went out for a run this morning. It was a beautiful Election Day morning. Vivid blue skies, puffy white clouds, and a wave of red that washed over everything for about ten minutes as the sun came up. I went past the elementary school where I used to vote before Washinton State switched to vote-by-mail exclusively. It's a little sad to not have that few minutes of real community on election day with the other neighbors lined up to vote and the volunteers at their alphabetical tables with their giant books of voter names. It's also a lot more convenient to be able to vote on my sofa in my underwear.

By the time I returned home, got showered and dressed, and headed out the door for work, the sky had grayed over for what is sure to be another dreary day in Seattle.

If the yard signs on my street are any indication, Ron Paul has this one wrapped up.

Voted on UWS of New York at 7:45 a.m. with my now-4-year-old for the first time (the last time around I didn't make it to vote, as I was in the hospital having just given birth to said 4-year-old). Line looked about 40 minutes long, but they were letting people who were registered in that district jump the line so it only took us about 20 minutes once I realized hey, wait, we're in district 99! There were a couple of really nice people with iphones walking along the line and offering to look up your district for you, just to be helpful.

I asked for a sticker for my very patient little guy, and the poll worker said, "Honey, we don't have stickers here. I'm just hoping we still have pens!" Sure enough, the lines for the private voting boxes were clustering around about 5 out of the 15 -- the ones that still had working pens attached. 

Am debating going back and bringing a box of pens.

Disseminating objectively false information about the election (e.g. ID requirements, polling times and places) should be a serious crime.

Actually, it's a little more complicated - the Board of Elections had 12,000 people signed up for a series of robocalls reminding them that they had until "7 pm tomorrow" to turn in their ballots. Those calls were all scheduled to go out on Monday, where "7 pm tomorrow" would be 7 pm on Tuesday.

But for some reason, a number of those 12,000 calls got rescheduled to go out TODAY - making "7 pm tomorrow" 7 pm on WEDNESDAY.

I mean, it sucks, but this looks more like "wacked-out computer glitch" as opposed to "someone intentionaly playing dirty pool." (Although, the articles' reports that two staff workers scoffed when people called to alert them to the problem - "that's impossible," they said. Then when they got a ton more calls they finally looked into it and realized "whoa shit" and started making human-type calls to fix the error.)

Who's blaming the poll workers? The idea that a touchscreen in 2012 needs to be "calibrated" is absurd. When was the last time you had to calibrate your cell phone or tablet's touchscreen? The touch targets are large enough on these things (or should be) that the calibration at the factory should be all that is needed.

It's the design of these machines that would allow this kind error (whether caused through human error at the polls or dirty tricks somewhere in the chain) to occur.

Having worked for a company that produces point-of-sale systems (hardware and software), I can assure you that touch screens do need to be calibrated. I can also attest to the fact that they can be so badly out of whack that touching button "a" registers a click on button "b".

The technology behind large, cheap touchscreens is not the same technology as the touchscreen on your phone.

A bunch of you guys seem to think I was making a positive statement when I was trying to make a normative one. We have technology for touchscreens that should not require post-factory calibration to be accurate enough to properly register a dozen or so touch zones on such a large screen. The fact that we're using cheap touchscreens that do need this calibration does not undermine my point that it's ridiculous that we're using older, shittier technology for something so important.

That is in part because the touchscreen element is actually a separate usb HID device that is laid over the screen in many cases. So the screen is really a giant transparent touchpad that sites over the monitor, then is sending element actions to portions of the screen. Since I am sure a good chunk of these machines are running windows of some sort, so the finger press on the screen is correlated to a mouse button press on a specific x,y coordinate on the same screen.

The ridiculous thing is that because there has been money funneling into these custom devices, 12 years ago, all of their functionality could probably be replicated using iPad's and their kiosk mode, along with a secure sandboxed application, and cost $600 a pop.

So, I live in upstate NY. At one level, I'd really, really like to vote for Jill Stein, in symbolic support of more ambitious environmental and social justice policies and ending drone warfare, corporate influence in politics, and corruption. 

I know that even in the aftermath of Sandy, people have been saying that New York will still go for Obama, but I can't help worrying that this won't happen, or that Obama won't win the popular vote or that I ought to enlarge that margin, or that I should vote for Obama because there are voters who won't get to do so because of voter suppression or because of Sandy--or because, when it comes down to it, he's quite possibly done the best he can do given the circumstances he has to navigate, and I would unquestionably prefer to see him lead the nation over Romney.

And yet I can't quite get myself to do the sensible thing and vote Obama, even though I know I might well regret it if I don't. I know that I need to escape being an anxious wreck over this and go vote for someone (who isn't Romney) already before the polls get too crowded. But I'm not there yet.

And yet I can't quite get myself to do the sensible thing and vote Obama, even though I know I might well regret it if I don't. 

I would import the idea of a carbon offset to this scenario. You want to support the greens, but you don't want Romney to be elected. It's much like you want to fly to Florida, but you don't want to contribute to global warming. So identify some action - a donation, a local party action you can take, a local race you can support a Green in, attendance at next elections Green convention - and use that as your political "offset" while you vote for the person you would prefer to actually lead the nation for the next 4 years.

Plus, whatever your offset is could help make the Greens stronger and more viable overall.

beryllium, I voted for Nader in 2000 (I was living in Texas, so there was no point at all in voting for Gore, and supporting the Green party seemed sensible) and while I still don't think my logic was flawed, emotionally I sort of wish I hadn't done it. (I voted for Kerry in '04, which was just as pointless but felt better.)

I voted yes, and I know a bunch of other people who will be voting yes.

beryllium - if you can't do it for Obama, think about some of the things Joe Biden has done, like drafting the Violence Against Women Act. 

He prompted Obama to come out in favor of gay marriage. My sister and I are both native Upstate New Yorkers. She (a MD resident now) just texted me to say that she got a little choked up voting for gay marriage. Like his slogan says: Forward. Under Obama's administration, we're moving ever forward. Progress may be slower that we'd like, but it is progress.

Today I brought my proudest achievement with me to the polls here in Virginia: my son, a brand-new 18-year-old Obama voter. 

"Romney's a lying tool," he said. Too much hate in the ads. Too many bald-faced lies. Too smarmy a snake-oil-salesman grin. Too much contempt for people who don't have piles of money to piss away on car elevators. He might not otherwise have cared much one way or the other, and under normal circumstances he is convinced that most human endeavors are pointless, but the relentless negative campaigning backfired and he was happy to get up at 7 a.m. and wait in line for an hour to vote with mom.

I voted this morning. It took about an hour. The woman in front of me in line complained at one point that the process was "so primitive." I looked around at the school gym we were all standing in. There were several hundred people waiting patiently in various lines and diligently bubbling in their votes, all of whom had woken up early or rearranged work to come in and participate in the election of our government. I'm not blind to the problems. The older I get, the more problems I see around me. I know our country is often terrible and that injustice is pervasive. I know that the voting process itself has serious flaws. But all of my usual cynicism just wasn't there in that moment for some reason. Instead I had tears in my eyes. I texted my mom (in case she was asleep, not because I am lame) "thanks for bringing me to this country - voting." Today is the opposite of primitive. Today is hopeful. The enterprise we are engaged in is hopeful. My mom brought me out of a country with no democracy in which non-anonymous sham votes could be cast in favor of the only candidate running for each office. I didn't say anything to the woman because, you know, morning, and also I don't like strangers, but in my imagination I kept saying "primitive? This is what it looks like to be civilized! If we can build on moments like these incrementally, anything is possible! America is possible!" We live in a nation founded on an idea with an aspirational constitution that we may never achieve, but what we're striving for is a vision of equality and freedom that I am proud of and that I love. Bit by bit, I hope to see it realized in my lifetime. Voting is making me cry because I live in an almost free country and I am happy and grateful.

I am 500 messages back in this thread and will never catch up. So...

I voted at 12:30 today at the elementary school I attended (and learned to square dance at). It took about 30 minutes to get through an efficiently run line. This is Virginia, and I live where a liberalish outpost meets a more traditional and conservative region. People were really engaged in the election, and I saw multiple families and one poor first-time voter whose mother was VERY concerned he didn't know what he was doing or how computers worked or that he knew anything about the electoral choices. He had to wave her away three times and assure her he'd be home after work twice before she let him alone. 

I voted for one candidate, against one candidate, and against a party and their super-annoying ads in the third race. I split my votes on the two referenda (no need for a constitutional change when there's a perfectly good and unchallenged state law on the books doing the same damn thing). I quadruple checked that my electronic votes were indicating who and what I wanted them to indicate and was out of there in 90 seconds. 

I miss voting by lever. I did that in my first in-person vote, and it was awesome.

Who's blaming the poll workers? The idea that a touchscreen in 2012 needs to be "calibrated" is absurd. When was the last time you had to calibrate your cell phone or tablet's touchscreen? The touch targets are large enough on these things (or should be) that the calibration at the factory should be all that is needed.

The capacitive touch screen technology used in tablets/cell phones is expensive to make on larger screens typically used in POS type devices. Conductors are actually fabricated into the glass, as I understand it, and don't have a great yield. The larger the glass, the worse the yield. POS terminals may use less expensive technology that doesn't need to be as accurate, and may need to be calibrated. (I think they sometimes use acoustic waves to detect touches. Not sure if this is the case for these voting machines, but it may be. It does seem like a touch screen problem to me, except why is it only the Romney-Obama race that reportedly has a problem and not the other races?

The ridiculous thing is that because there has been money funneling into these custom devices, 12 years ago, all of their functionality could probably be replicated using iPad's and their kiosk mode, along with a secure sandboxed application, and cost $600 a pop.

....or we could just use plain old pen and paper, which actually works, and costs like fifty cents a voter. Voting is great here in Washington, where we all get paper ballots in the mail with weeks to spare, and we can vote at home with a pen, and where there are no crazy overcomplicated high-tech wacko machines to change our votes for us. Y'all should try it.

I have one long time, uber-radical friend in particular who refuses to vote because Obama is "mediocre" and she has no other options on her ballot to believe in. In searching for something to use as a way of talking to her about it, I came across this quote from an article in The Feminist Wire. 

"Yesterday, we read a number of eloquent arguments about why some people are choosing to abstain from voting. And while we respect our friends and the decisions they are making, we are troubled by the suggestion that abstention from voting marks a step toward an ethical higher ground. In our view, this is simply not the case.

Voting, in and of itself, is neither wholly system-changing nor inherently conciliatory; it is one available gesture in the series of actions through which those of us committed to an anti-oppressive politics live our lives."

How have you been successful in talking to people about voting who hold similar views? It is a struggle I frequently face because of the politics of my communities.
posted by anya32 at 11:36 AM on November 6, 2012 [4 favorites]


A bunch of you guys seem to think I was making a positive statement when I was trying to make a normative one. We have technology for touchscreens that should not require post-factory calibration to be accurate enough to properly register a dozen or so touch zones on such a large screen. The fact that we're using cheap touchscreens that do need this calibration does not undermine my point that it's ridiculous that we're using older, shittier technology for something so important.

With what money? There's tens of thousands of precincts in the US; changing each state's voting technology is a multimillion dollar project for something that gets used, max, a couple times a year. There's about three companies making this stuff, there's only 50-odd customers, and those customers only buy new product once every twenty years.

Regardless of who wins the election, we U.S. types, as a group, should push for massive, national election reform. To quote David Frum (and he's not a person I'd normally quote):
Almost everywhere else, elections are run by impartial voting agencies. In France, elections are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which establishes places and hours of voting, prints ballots (France still uses paper) and counts the votes. In Germany, an independent federal returning officer oversees a complex state and federal voting system. In Canada, federal elections are managed by a specialized agency, Elections Canada. Mexico, emerging from a sad history of electoral manipulation, created in the 1990s a respected independent agency, the Federal Electoral Institute. Brazil has nationwide electronic voting, producing instantaneous, uncontested results...

But here's what doesn't happen in other democracies:

Politicians of one party do not set voting schedules to favor their side and harm the other. Politicians do not move around voting places to gain advantages for themselves or to disadvantage their opponents. In fact, in almost no other country do politicians have any say in the administration of elections at all.
The whole opinion piece is worth a read. Nothing new to most folks, but it does put it in one place.

Anyhow, yeah, voting methods, hours, locations, etc. shouldn't be controlled by partisans.

In my country(but not my precinct thankfully) there was a split precinct where voters from 2 different areas could vote. That sounds like a dangerous idea. And it was. The poll workers failed to code some of the machines for precinct 1 and some for precinct 7, thus causing some unknown number of voter so vote in the wrong congressional race. The error was caught and they have decided to invalidate the congressional votes of 189 ballots, as they have no confidence that the voters were voting on the correct race. The presidential votes will still count.

It's a human error, it happens. However, I'm more concerned that roughly 90 (assuming even distribution) voters voted for Congressional candidates that don't represent them, and didn't even notice. Given my locale, it's a fairly safe bet they were voting straight Republican. 

Part of me thinks it's a travesty that they have essentially been disenfranchised. Another part thinks they shouldn't be voting in the first place if they are checking off names they don't even recognize.

Then after you get inside and round the corner, you can see that the election workers have let the line snake over way, way down a long side hallway and back again. Cue sad trombone effect.

The fun part was getting to the front of the line and watching new people come in, round the corner and realize the line was 3-4 times longer than they thought it was.

Only 45 minutes to get through everything though, and it seemed even faster. We have good elections workers and judges here.

Because of the (soooo bullllshittttt) California proposition system and my need to be an informed voter, it took me about six hours of reading and research to figure out how to vote. But I think it's worth it. It's quite simply the least I can do for my new home.

I'm signed up to vote by mail but wanted to drop my ballot off so I could see my actual polling place so I did that this morning. It's at a senior citizen center so it's nicely heated to approximately 105F. I arrived around 8:45 (polls open at 8am here) and found myself in a line of about 20 people. The man behind me said it was the only time he's ever seen a line to vote for anything. We discussed a bit how horrible it is that people have to wait in lines over an hour long in some places (basically, shit-talking Florida a bit). 

It turns out that I could have just skipped the line, so when I found that out, I went over to the dropoff place, put my ballot in the box and got my sticker. San Mateo County's sticker game is patriotic realness. Waved bye to my new friend and headed out to pick up some bagels for my coworkers. I could hear a few other people in line exclaiming how they'd never seen anything like it.

And no lie: I cried a little. It was an amazing feeling to finally be able to join with my community - for real, in person, with my actual neighbours - to engage in this process. I would have happily stood in that line all day to do it.

if the results are that Obama carries VA,FL, and OH, it's pretty much over and done. The game is up, and even if they aren't calling it officially, it's the same thing as calling it.

Romney can have FL. If Obama carries OH and VA, it's over.
Romney would need NH, WI, IA, CO AND NV. Not going to happen.

The lady checking everyone in demanded a second form of ID, even though it says right there on the registration card that the card itself is acceptable.

So, my dog (literally) ate my voter registration card. What he didn't eat he shredded up into a million tiny bits. This is it taped back together.

I voted in Chicago this morning, with this bedraggled card. Some (but not all) of the ID information is missing. I offered my driver's license so they could compare, and the poll worker said, "nope, we don't want to see it, you have your card--this is great!"

I voted in a rec center with posters made in the shape of ice cream sundaes by little kids, and each sundae had quotes on it about why they want the rec center to stay open. "The rec center keeps us out of trouble" "A place to play basketball after school" "Somewhere we can do our homework" "A safe place to play." I waited for an hour in line and was looking at those signs the whole time. 

My local library does something similar and it depresses me to near-suicidal levels. 

I'm going to the gym right after work- I figure that working out for two hours will make the long grind from eight pm onward less terrifying.

I voted early weeks ago.

Sunday, I was out canvassing for the Obama grassroots campaign, and the turf they sent me to was a particularly ratty set of apartment complexes on the north edge of the city. I brought my 15-year-old daughter with me, in the spirit of teaching her about democracy.

Little could have emotionally prepared me for the experience; wandering through dingy hallways over brown-stained floors and knocking on thin, faded hollow-core doors with the apartment numbers scrawled on them with a hasty sharpie. Bleary-eyed children in diapers answered the doors and stared at me blankly as I asked for their parents. Hunched adults pushed past me, not daring to make eye contact or stop when I asked them if they planned to vote on Tuesday. Aside from a couple of alert, enthusiastic ladies in a corner apartment, everybody seemed defeated.

As we walked through a courtyard from one building to another, a group of children played with a broken shopping cart. I smiled and waved and they gave me wary looks until we passed.

I knocked on more doors, trying to turn out the black, Hmong, Latino, the elderly fading into poverty. I thought to myself that if only half would come to the polls, then if only a third would come to the polls, and then if only a quarter would come to the polls. Even if only those two alert, enthusiastic ladies in the corner apartment make it.

Somebody just tell me even the smallest difference can be made for these people. Raise my taxes so they can catch a breath or a break or something. Anything. Just tell me these people have something to look forward to.

Diablevert: As if the status quo is simple? You want to talk wasted money? Look at the phalanxes of lawyers we have out there trying to rig elections or prevent elections from being rigged. Look at the resources that go into these antiquated, closed-source electronic systems. I recognize that amending the constitution is a high bar, but this is a major problem in our democracy, so I think it's worth trying.

My personal feeling is that, pragmatically, you'd get a lot further with a state-by-state grassroots campaign to convert touch screen states to optical scanners. The praises that people have been singing in this thread for pptical scanners are non-partisan convincers --- in an election environment where both sides have been hurling claims of voter fraud at each other, I think the idea of having a clear paper trail to turn to in the event of a recount is something that the vast majority of people would support. 

Whereas, as Miko points out, trying to set up a federal body to run elections would attract hardcore opposition in a large swathes of the country --- state's rights! Etc. --- that would almost certainly doom any constitutional amendment, which requires a large supermajority of states. Plus, if you want to talk dollars and cents and waste and effort, a successful constitutional amendment would like take decades to pass and cost tens if not hundreds of millions. Local good governance reform's a lot cheaper.

So, several years back, we had our BOE elections and because I hadn't done any research, I voted for names I recognized.

Turns out the reason I recognized one of those names is because the candidate was a nutso "teach the bible in biology class and make sure to use the word 'Fag' a lot" sort of person. 

I voted for her because I knew her name but didn't bother to do any research. 

The Presidential election isn't all that's at stake here today. Indeed, the Federal Races aren't all that is at stake today. The people you vote for in your state and city elections are going to profoundly impact how you live in a much more tangible way than the feds.

So, what I'm saying is, don't be a moron like I was. Do your research on your local candidates and ballot issues and make some smart choices. And, west coast people, don't be discouraged by the results of the national races. The difference you make locally trumps the national results.

Romney Megaprayer is interesting because it's a hoax, but people are taking part in it anyway.

"A month ago I found a site: literallyunbelievable.org/ It’s people who think stories from The Onion are real.

It got me thinking a lot about Poe’s Law - the idea that two people can see the same thing very differently.

I wanted to create something that would be satirical to one group and be taken seriously by another.

On Tuesday, October 30th I put up a site:
RomneyMegaPrayer.com

I've have a few observations from watching it percolate across the Internet.

1) Conservative Christians aren't as chatty as atheists on Twitter, but they do sign up. There are more than 1,700 people praying for Romney to win Monday night. This means that the Romney Mega Prayer is the Schrödinger's cat of political websites. It's both real and satire at the same time.

2) Liberal/Non-theistic people were far more susceptible to believing it was real than I ever expected. I think their expectations of Christian Conservatives is so low that they were ready to accept that this was real.

3) Even though the science and the history citations were of low credibility, few people (or fewer than I had hoped) would just come right out and call it a hoax. Almost no one questioned who was behind this or why the site had no authorship or attribution. This one bothers me the most. Why didn't people ask or look for this?"

(I think see: 2 answers this one myself, and the kind of people that would take it seriously are not rigorous fact checkers by nature.)

Today I brought my proudest achievement with me to the polls here in Virginia: my son, a brand-new 18-year-old Obama voter. 

Reminds me of the most personally discouraging scuttlebut in my immediate family: 21-year-old brother, utterly uninterested in politics, completely unmoved by how important I consider it to be (I was willing to move to Florida over the summer as paid OFA staff, but juuust missed the qualifying threshold), and yet he's out of the blue registered and planning to vote for Romney... apparently because his new girlfriend (from Texas!) told him to. Probably can't even name the running mates, much less the radical things one of them has in store for his future, yet hung up on me ~30 seconds into my first and only attempt at a "Hey, this is kind of important, I want to talk to you about this" conversation. The birth of close-mindedness is an ugly, ugly thing.

Sam Wang's final final: As I wrote late last night, Florida is a hard case. Several new polls came out this morning, making the median basically zero. As a tie-breaker I resorted to mean-based statistics. I will be unsurprised for it to go either way. Nate Silver and Drew Linzer went the other way. We are all tossing coins. I am prepared to lose the coin toss.

In Florida, a recount is triggered by a margin of 0.5% or less (recount rules, Brennan Center for Justice). I estimate that there is a 50-50 chance of a recount. We might not know the exact outcome for some time.

The next-closest state is North Carolina, with margin of Romney +1.0%. All other margins are 2% or greater.

Reporting from Cleveland Heights, a dark blue dot in the light blue wash that is North East Ohio, the bluest of the Five Ohios.

96 houses on the block; only three have Romney and/or Mandell (Senator Sherrod 'Scratchy' Brown's opponent) yard signs -- up from two sets of GOP signs in 2008. 

One house on my block has an actual, official, professionally printed, not-crayons-on-cardboard "Gary Johnson for President" yard sign -- the only one I've ever seen.

But all-in-all, this is pretty safe Dem / Obama territory. 

They moved our polling place again. In 13 years, we've voted in four different locations. Voting took almost an hour. There was a bit of a line, but mainly chaos, incompetence, and no-one being in charge. Poll workers, like the neighborhood, were ethnically diverse, which is nice to see. Not the most chaos, worst lines, or longest wait -- that was 2004. 

There was one creepy guy in a suit and flag-themed tie holding a clipboard and chatting amicably with the poll workers whom I assume was a GOP 'poll monitor'. There was no trouble. Just the usual disorganized asynchronous polyphony.

Data point: Meanwhile, down in Boehner's district, my 88 year old father (who voted for Nixon three times and James F-ing Rhodes [see: May 4, 1970] countless times) is voting disgustedly against Boehner again and cheerfully for Obama again. So here's one old white guy and one very old white guy to confound the demographers. 

= = = = = 

I'm curious how they handle people with no street address, since you can register by just giving vague directions to where you live ("down by the river, about a hundred yards from the tire dump").

My experience when I lived on a boat and had no street address was that no you cannot, you have to just make one up and register fraudulently.

I was able to vote once in the 1970s when my address was 1964 Electra Parkedway, apt. #225.

I was kind of shocked at the amount of soliciting at my polling place. There were people knocking on our car windows as we were parking to hand us pamphlets. I've voted in California more than any other state where that kind of thing is strictly verboten so it was very unsettling to me.

I think it was in '96 or '00 - I was still living on the Lower East Side, anyway - and some dude showed up at my polling place wearing a huge Clinton t-shirt, and over that was a jean jacket to which he'd sewn a Clinton patch, and he also had a Clinton bumper sticker pinned to his backpack and another one slapped on his bike helmet. He got into line to vote dressed like that, and for several minutes people were just giving him dirty looks, but then one person finally said something and he snapped back and then everyone else in the damn room jumped all over him because "you aren't supposed to be campaigning so close to the polls." I think people actually chased him out to the lobby so he could take off his jacket and turn his shirt inside out and put his helmet in his bag or something.

Pretty much everyone else was also voting for Clinton too anyway, but people knew the rules, dammit.

When I voted in Park Slope, two unrelated men were reading Žižek books in line. They were the only people reading paper books in line. It was an odd coincidence. 

Also, right by the polling place, there was a cafe that had only been open for a week. They were thoroughly overwhelmed by the caffeine demands of our myriad, voting Park Slope Moms.

Hm, getting back to the nationalized elections tangent -- I'm not a lawyer, but it was pointed out to me that Article I vests Congress with the power to regulate elections for the Senate and House. It would obviously be a massive inconvenience for the states to hold separate elections for President using separate machines / ballots / whatever, right? So, couldn't Congress exercising its Article I power to regulate these elections create and end-around approach to nationalizing the Presidential elections?

I was kind of shocked at the amount of soliciting at my polling place.

I was surprised at the complete lack of anyone outside the polling place here. No one at all. That was very strange compared to years past. In fact, I've been struck by the relative lack of yard signs in my neighborhood this year. In '08, the streets were festooned with McCain/Palin signage with the two or three lone Obama signs mixed in. This year, I think I've seen exactly one Romney sign on my street and, maybe, one Obama bumpersticker.

I'm not sure what that means, but it sure doesn't look like much support for Romney in this corner of bright-red state.

I was kind of shocked at the amount of soliciting at my polling place.

Yes, the "No on N" people are insane in Richmond, Calif. Measure N is a tax on sodas, and it's being fought with a bazillion dollars by the soft drink companies. I sort of wonder if Richmond has ever seen this much money and complete bullshit slung over any other Measure. Total mob scene with posters and vans full of people bused in to vote No on N (and get a free T-shirt with "No on N!" written on it!)

I hate nanny state measures. I hate regressive taxes. The guy who wrote it is every annoying stereotype about sanctimonious and patronizing leftists, and campaigns entirely by means of the false dilemma fallacy. But what I hate most of all is when the people on "my" side are the sort of odious, corrupt, and shameless liars that these "No on N" fuckers are.

Quite a few in Minnesota, sadly. 

Report just in: It [a posted sign/prayer of some kind] asks God to "Grant to us all the gift of courage to proclaim and defend your plan for marriage, which is the union of one man and one woman in a lifelong, exclusive relationsiop of loving trust, compassion, and generosity, open to the conception of children." The report is that it's within the prohibited 100 feet of a polling place. 

The biggest Catholic church in my area has had "Vote Yes" campaign signs up for weeks. I think it's blatantly illegal, but apparently that's only my personal opinion. My understanding is that State of MN isn't pursuing cases like this that don't involve candidates specifically, and the IRS has been generally hopeless in responding to complaints based on tax-exempt status.

stupidsexyflanders, I bet you're thinking of this comment:
The larger the elections, the less important yard signs are. 

[...]

Some general vote getting effectiveness guidelines are:
Direct mail: gets one vote for every 500 pieces of mail sent when targeted at undecideds.
Phone banking: gets one vote for every 400 calls when targeted.
Canvass visit from a stranger: gets one vote for every 300 door knocks when targeted.
Personal canvass visit from a neighbor: gets one vote for every 12 visits.
Partisan voter guides/cheat sheets handed out at the polls: gets one vote for every 10 handouts.
The most effective vote getting mechanisms are the things most people are least likely to do: visit their neighbors and be outside their polling place talking to their neighbors.
(The comment is much longer than this, and interesting. Later in the thread, the poster pops back in to comment on where those numbers came from.)

This is the first time since I moved back to the States (in 2004) that I voted by mail. I do miss going to the polling place and joining in the shared public ritual of enacting democracy, but I knew today would be hectic and I didn't want to risk not being able to make it there in Imelda.

My plan is to set myself up with a couple of bottles of wine, old episodes of The West Wing, and this thread on my iPad when I get home in an hour or so. I'll spend the rest of the afternoon, evening, and late night hours trying to get some work done while multitasking with my election obsession.

Tomorrow morning I have to give a talk on social media and electoral politics to a bunch of international journalists, so it's a mostly legit way to spend the time, right? The wine is just civilization.

*snerk* - the talk of yard signs has reminded me of something from my hometown. The patriarch of the family who was friends with my family for years ended up in Connecticut state politics (did quite well, in fact); even though he had the rather difficult-to-spell-or-pronounce surname "Pawelkiewicz". One year, another Democrat on the state legislature had the similarly-long surname "Vertefeuille". 

My neighbor kept a record of some of the creative mis-spellings of both names, and reported that at some point she saw a yard sign on someone's house that read "Vote for Walter P-something and Dan V-something".

mudpuppie--I noticed up above you mentioned the poll worker not wanting to look at your ID. I just saw in an article on MN's election that our poll workers are specifically instructed not to look at IDs, and maybe yours are, too. We have a proposed amendment to add an ID requirement to our constitution right now, so it's a hot button issue. Many states are grappling with this issue, so they are probably overly sensitive about it.

...I am usually too shy to actually post anything substantive, but perhaps this is a place to share the open letter I wrote on Facebook about MN's proposed Voter ID amendment:

Hi friends,
Today I volunteered for Our Vote Our Future to call people and chat about the proposed Voter ID amendment. I know when I first heard about this proposal, it didn't seem like that bad a thing to me--after all, most people have IDs, right? But when I learned a little more I realized it's more complicated than that: 
1. There are actually a lot of groups of people for whom it's more difficult than you might think to get an ID or to make sure it's current. Someone like my grandmother, who doesn't drive, doesn't need a current drivers license. 20% of people born before 1930 have never had a birth certificate, and would have a difficult time getting the necessary documents together to get a new ID. Many older people would also have a difficult time finding transportation to the DMV and putting in the time to go through the renewal process, and the same is true for people with physical disabilities. College students or other young people with shifting addresses might not have their current residence listed on their ID, and the same would be true for anyone with housing instability. City dwellers who rely on public transportation might not have drivers licenses, which means this will affect low income people disproportionally. People of color are also more likely to be affected by this restriction, as are immigrants. People who live in rural areas, for whom the nearest DMV is a couple hours' drive, will have a much harder time renewing their IDs. Other states that have passed similar legislation have made exceptions for certain groups of people--elders and overseas military, for example--but the proposed amendment for our state does not. All these people have the right to vote. 

2. The permanence of a constitutional amendment is extreme and inappropriate. This is not just an ordinary law--it would be permanently added to our constitution, where it would be very difficult to amend or repeal. We would stand with Mississippi as one of only two states to actually amend the constitution over this issue.

3. The language that would actually be added to the constitution is much longer and more complicated than what you will see on your ballot. It is also vague and leaves a lot to be decided later. For example, they say that they will pay for valid voters to get an ID, but don't define where the money to do so will come from, what the process would be for applying, or whether they would also cover the attendant costs that come with application (like the transportation for the rural person mentioned above). We also don't even know who will be in the legislature when these decisions are being made, so we don't know who will be making these decisions. I am not comfortable voting for something without knowing what the end product will be.

4. Implementing this amendment will be expensive: Local elections officials and the Secretary of State’s office estimate that it would cost state and local governments $50 million or more to implement a complicated new system. It is an unfunded mandate that doesn't specify how to cover costs of implementation.

5. Minnesota's voting system is nationally recognized for being clean and fair. The idea that we need to prevent voter fraud is a solution for a problem that does not exist. The only fraudulent voting that I have heard of is occasional cases of convicted felons voting, but they have access to IDs and would not be affected by this amendment. In my mind, preventing the legitimate voters I mentioned above from voting is a much larger concern. There is every reason to protect our existing system and no reason to make such a costly and harmful overhaul.

6. This amendment would effectively end election day registration and absentee mail-in voting (both of which I myself have used in the past!), and would set up a complicated two-step system of provisional balloting where votes would only be counted in the case of a very close election. The details are still hazy on how it would work.

I am very proud that Minnesota has the largest voter turn out in the country; this amendment would give us one of the most restrictive voter policies. 

Please vote no, and talk to your friends and family to make sure they know about the unintended consequences of this amendment. It might sound simple at first, but when you look closer it's clear that this is not the right choice for our state. Vote No!

I don't know anything about the legality of this, but I think in the Cities at least, the churches with huge ass "Vote NO" signs far outnumber the "Vote Yes" churches.

This is my reminder that I must get over to the southside more often, I guess.

When the "Vote Yes" signs sprouted at my neighborhood Catholic church (not naming names directly here, but you'll know which one it is--the big one on Stinson just over the city limit in St. Anthony), on a corner that I drive past constantly, I was royally peeved. It was a weekend afternoon, so I took 20 minutes or so to drive around and see if any of the other Catholic churches in this part of town had them. At that time, the other ones (the little quirky Slavic or Lebanese ethnic ones closer to the river) were sign-free. I haven't checked since September.

Lots of "Another Catholic Voting No" signs in people's front yards within a block or two of the big church, so there's that, too.

There were three people ahead of me in line to vote this afternoon. Due to a snafu with my registration, it took a while before I could get my ballot (first name was entered as my last name, oops). I ended up being #933, which is pretty good turnout around here. I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for the candidates I want. I live in a fairly Democratic-leaning part of the city, but the state is as red as it gets.

While I was there getting my name confusion worked out, no fewer than three people were sent to other precincts.

Others reported 30 minute to an hour waits at other precincts throughout the city this morning.

Wa-a-a-y upthread, like 45 seconds ago, someone mentioned the site that is my obsession in these times, electoral-vote.com. 

This evening, the Votemaster will blank out his maps and switch to live-blogging the election results via the maps:
Live Blogging of the Election Tonight 
Starting around 6 P.M. EST or so, the main page and Senate pages will switch to blank maps that will be updated throughout the evening as election results come in. 

But be aware that very early reports can be confusing. If Austin happens to report first, Texas might be dark blue for a little while. If problems in New York City due to the storm delay reporting until after upstate districts report, New York might be dark red for a while. 

But it will be interesting to see the colors spread out from east to west as the results come in. Come back tonight.

If you want to feel hope for humanity, drive the neighborhoods south of Lake Calhoun and count the Vote No signs. Don't bother counting the Vote Yes signs, there literally aren't any.

I wish churches wouldn't put political signs of any flavor on their property, but at least with the Vote No signs the message is "government shouldn't restrict this", whereas the Vote Yes signs distill down to "I don't like teh gayz and therefore I'm willing to allow my government to overtly discriminate". Outside of the opinion on the issue itself, it speaks volumes on what someone with this viewpoint is willing to allow a government to do to enforce their narrow mindset.

One thing that a lot of people seem to miss is that a President on their 2nd term does not face reelection. That means the NEXT presidential election will be a fresh slate. THAT means that both parties will be running on what they accomplished or can take credit for over the past 4 years. Gridlock is not a big accomplishment.

Therefore, what you could expect to see is a lot of compromising and then trying to take credit for stuff from both sides. (Yeah, I'm looking at you True Immigration Reform). If the Republicans don't get out in front with Dems on that you are looking at a Blue Texas very soon and on into the indefinite future. (not to mention a few other states)

Yeah, I'm feeling sick to my stomach after reading that Salon piece on the unverified software patches Husted had installed for 39 counties in Ohio.

I'd known about it for a few days now and kept hoping a major story would come out about it, and took as a sign that it wasn't very alarming to "those in the know" or it would've splashed bigtime across the bigger papers...

It's just so ugly and slimy on so many levels, and I wouldn't doubt it being some sort of mindfuckery on this Husted guys part as to create even more doubt about the soundness of the vote if this is close and a recount is ordered. I honestly cannot believe thought that those counties wouldn't have raw CSV files that would undo any tampering that might be a "man in the middle" attack.

I just hope it's not close for that guy to game it. It seems mostly a way to tabulated the results in more specific ways. I guess that could be a cover though, if the patch allows writing, yes?

One year, another Democrat on the state legislature had the similarly-long surname "Vertefeuille". 

When I was a kid in NC, one of my first political memories (well before being able to vote, mind you), was of Nick Galifianakis running for Senate against Jesse Helms. They had some fun with the long name--they stretched it across two campaign buttons.

That's even worse. Altering totals takes way less effort than altering ballots. I saw the part where they changed the format from XML to CSV (which is also perplexing as an "upgrade"), but that's only what is stated. The installation of a patch onto the county tabulation systems introduces new code that could carry so much more than a format change. As you said, they could just create a central format converter that took all the XML from the counties and created a CSV to feed into the state tabulation system -- why compromise county systems with new software for a format change?

I cannot conceive of even the stupidest programmer I know of coming up with something as inane as what they say the patch is supposed to do.

Campaigns are realizing that yard signs and bumper stickers make supporters feel good but don't do much to change minds. The money is better spent on ads, canvassing, phone calls, etc.

The one piece of evidence in that article is pretty minimal and of dubious relevance. Signs don't stay up for 11 hours on election eve, they slowly spread through a campaign. Also, making supporters feel good is not a bad idea. People who campaign like to feel that they're getting somewhere. Signs are a good physical marker of territory covered.

But it does. This "cliff" was not caused by some mysterious unknown. It was created by people. Systems or institutions of people, supported by other people (often in government). And it can be addressed, but it will take time and takes leadership with that same goal in mind. Now I am not one of those "Democrats" are perfect people - I have complaints, just like many others do. But the choice is clear that Obama and Romney will try to take the government and economy in different directions. "Try" because Republicans are excellent obstructionists and perhaps, someday, Democrats will learn a thing or two about it. (Also, not ignoring third party candidates, but the reality is that they are not winning highest office this year - many have great ideas). What I keep saying to people is this - have you ever had problems with your finances and balancing your books? Had a lot of debt? ("Yes, but I finally resolved them, paid of my debt, etc."). Were you able to fix it immediately, save winning the lottery, or did it take a long-term strategy and life changes to move forward? How could a complicated financial market be turned around quickly? It can't. It takes time. It takes new policies. It takes addressing the actual causes of the current economic woes - and that includes holding people accountable, in my book. The economy has slowly been inching forward. Obama had some great ideas that Republicans did not allow to move forward. The big picture needs to be taken in. And that, I believe, clearly shows that voting does matter.

The fiscal cliff is not a cliff. It would take weeks or even months for the spending cuts to make their way through the budgetary process of various government agencies. The depth of the cuts are savage enough that we shouldn't be too cavalier about it, but we also shouldn't rush to get a deal done by December 31 if it's a bad deal. Doing a deal after January 1 means a more level playing field for negotiations and a more balanced resolution to the problem.

It took me nearly two hours to vote this morning; I think it took about 45 minutes in '08. Anecdotally, the line looked longer than '08's, but that was probably the result of a broken machine more than turnout. Apparently there were a lot of broken machines in my area. 

Intellectually, I know Obama has the odds, but I'm not nearly as confident as I was in '08. I'm terrified of the known unknowns and even more so of the unknown unknowns. Election eves are brutal on me, always like a cross between Christmas Eve and a final exam I'm not prepared for.

I've been a poll worker, too. The Republican who was chief election judge the last time I was there succesfully railroaded everyone, except me, into signing all the end-of-the-night documents (like the list of handicapped voters who needed assistance from a judge to complete their ballots) ahead of time, "so we could finish up quick tonight".

I objected that I wasn't going to sign anything until I was happy with the contents of it. She turned away in a snit, saying that unlike me, she was brought up to trust people.

So, no, they aren't good people - they're people, just like all the other people.

ultraviolet catastrophe: For the record it's not ballots but totals. Furthermore the report wasn't encrypted before the change. The modification outlined in the article changes the format of the export from XML to CSV.

How do you know that, ob1?
Well, I guess I don't. I'm relying on the report in the Salon article.
It’s not entirely clear how the new version of EXP will differ from the existing one, though the contract specifies the older version created XML-formatted files instead of plain-text CSV files.
Both XML and CSV are plaintext formats, so I'm not sure why the reporter felt the need to draw that distinction. None the less, neither format is encrypted by default.

Standing in line to vote in Arlington, Virginia right now. Been here since before 4pm, and I'm still only about halfway to the actual school/gym entrance. Looks like they are letting in people in batches, but no idea if there's a line inside too (there was in 2008). 

Everyone is very quiet and patient, despite the temperature dropping and it becoming rather chilly. No heavy electioneering at all, only a few people handing out sample ballots (Dems, Repubs & Greens so far). Looks like the garden signs have been carefully placed so they are not too close to the building. A bunch of kids here with their parents too, and a decently diverse crowd. 

Pretty much a model election so far, guess we'll se how it holds up on the inside!

You should take a breath and walk away from the 'puter. I have a hard time coming up with a less reasonable predictor for an election result than Intrade.

For a reference point, in sports gambling over the long haul one very good bet to make is anyone who is playing the Dallas Cowboys, because they are chronically overvalued because they have a myopic fan base, and in parimutuel betting that drives the odds incorrectly in one direction. Seriously.

Both XML and CSV are plaintext formats, so I'm not sure why the reporter felt the need to draw that distinction.

I think the CSV is the compatible format with other voting systems in place in the state but that still begs the question: why install a patch on multiple county systems rather than convert the XML to CSV at the central input?

The likely answer for me is also the really scary one: to hide something in the patch at the source tabulator.

Having all tabulators agree in their tabulation means any alteration won't be detected unless a manual count of the ballots is performed.

I just got back from voting in Alphabet City -- took an hour, when usually I don't have to wait more than about 20 minutes in the middle of the afternoon. According to the poll worker I talked to, turnout is definitely up but I suspect it's mostly about the new electronic voting. This is the first year we haven't used the old-skool lever machines and I miss 'em. Now we have to sign in, get a ballot, fill it out, then have it scanned. They hadn't thought through the different stations very well so it's all a snarl of intersecting lines. But everyone is pretty cheerful nonetheless. 

I did hear things were worse at other polling places, including one near Union Square, where 13 poll workers just didn't show up.

Before I voted, I was volunteering with Occupy Sandy out in Staten Island so I'm very, very grateful to have a warm, dry place to wait out the results.

Touchscreens can get off-calibration so your touch is registered offset from where you actually touched. 

In the article I read the voter said he specifically checked for that:
Being a software developer, I immediately went into troubleshoot mode. I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney’s name and started tapping very closely together to find the ‘active areas’. From the top of Romney’s button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama’s name was all active for Romney. From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. Stein’s button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.

Basically, the prices on the left are prices that people are willing to buy shares of Romney winning tonight, and the size of the buy order. So, for example, 10000 shares at 28.0 means a purchase order where each share is worth $2.80 (100% = $10, 0% = 0). So that is $28,000 worth of purchases. So it looks like someone spent roughtly $100,000 keeping Romney shares above 28%.

Well, essentially Obama has 237 electoral votes that are, for want of a better word, guaranteed. That means he needs 33 more to win. Of the in-play states, if he wins any two or more of Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, or Florida, then game's over (since New Hampshire's 4 EVs are likely his as well). There will be no math that can get around that.

Granted, networks love viewers to stick around all night and watch, so they might not want to call that early. But essentially this election could be totally decided by 8:15 PM EST.

I cast an early vote on Friday; the line at that library was not as long as they'd been to vote early in 2004, but still about a half hour wait. The part of me that gets superstitious at hockey games was spooked about voting there again after 04, so I called a friend to de-jinx me. There was a news truck parked outside the building, and while I waited in line a news helicopter circled overhead. 

That seemed very topical somehow, getting filmed standing in a voter waiting line while on the phone with my friend in NYC who still had no power. 

I got a text during my wait: "Channel 28 is showing the voters! What are you wearing?"
I wrote back: "My ugly sweater."
The reply I got: "Which one?" Okay, that's fair.

My Awesome Hippie Mom, meanwhile, did her ballot by mail and has since been bemoaning the lack of ritual involved in voting. She misses the curtain, and she especially misses the lever, because it made her vote feel so decisive and solid.

There is nothing that will generate outcry for election reform than a irrevocably failed and unverifiable election. I don't mean, "crisis in Florida in 2000, which clearly ended with the Supreme Court stopping recounts" failure; I mean a systematic error in which a Secretary of State has to go up to a podium and say "the computer fucked up, we have no paper trail, and we don't know who won the state, and we have no idea what to do." Riots will likely have to happen and dozens will have to lose their jobs over it.

And then we hugged.

I swear they called it before then last time. I remember having a lot of food and drink untouched when they called it.

In 2008, I remember them holding off until the last poll closed, but then it took an excruciatingly long 13 seconds to broadcast the winner. It was horrible.

Seriously...it was clear that after about 30 seconds after the polls had closed, they had known the winner a couple of hours earlier. This one might be different if the sliver of a difference is real as opposed to the larger gap between Obama and McCain.

As predicted, no line, and the poll workers were on their game today and had no trouble finding me in the list or getting me a ballot (for the primary, it was a bit complicated because I'm registered Green, and they didn't think they had any Green ballots). One other guy voting at the time; took me ~2 mins to fill in my bubbles and walk back home.

Aside from the Prez, I voted for school taxes/bonds on three occasions; with apologies to THE BLOOD GOD, voted to end capital punishment; voted more against the sociopathic mayoral candidate than for the Dem one; voted pro-union; and otherwise voted pretty straight Dem ticket.

Massachusetts voters - who else was surprised by the Citizens United ballot question 4? I thought there were only 3 ballot questions this time around. 

Ballot Questions Intended To Send Leaders A Message
... in a pair of little-noticed, nonbinding ballot questions, some Massachusetts voters have the opportunity to tell the newly elected officials what they would like them to do when they get to Capitol Hill.

In much of Greater Boston, voters will consider an antiausterity measure that would call on elected officials to prevent cuts to social insurance programs by instead reducing military spending and raising taxes on the wealthy.

A second question, on the ballot in about one-third of the state, urges support for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case, which struck down campaign finance restrictions on corporations, labor unions, and advocacy groups. The amendment would declare that Congress and the states may place limits on political contributions and that “corporations are not entitled to the constitutional rights of human beings.”

... The nonbinding questions are meant as barometers of public opinion, and carry no legal force.

Each question will appear on the ballot in more than 30 legislative districts, an unusually high number for nonbinding questions. In a grass-roots effort, proponents of each collected signatures district-by-district, so some ballots will include one question but not the other.

While the measures have received little attention, proponents say they are more than symbolic and deserve consideration.

I put on The Internatinale right after this land is your land.

No one noticed.

In a country where Barack Obama is frighteningly left wing, I'm not sure The Internationale would register. You could also play Robert Wyatt's version of The Red Flag. People would probably think Christmas was coming early. 

By the way, as a filthy foreigner, I can highly recommend the pieces-of-paper-and-a-pencil method. All you need in the polling station are booths and sealed boxes, and they're fairly cheap. Of course, you don't get to syphon money off to the people who bankrolled your campaign, but other than that, it's a pretty good method.

Checking in to say voting in Bed Stuy has been a disaster. I voted midday, got there about 1:45 p.m. and got home about 4:30 p.m. For some reason, several of the precincts were unexpectedly closed within the last few days -- meaning people were coming in from myriad election districts, and there was a line snaking through the elementary school halls of people didn't know which district they were supposed to vote in. 

If you did know which district you were voting in, you were directed to a line and told to wait there, which took about forty-five minutes. It was like a victory when we finally got into the gymnasium. Except ...

Inside the gym, there were no signs, no taped off areas to keep folks within specific lines, and there was no way of being certain you were waiting in the right place. The lines were pretty single-file near the back of the gymnasium, but as one approached the check-in tables it became apparent that the front of the room was a mob scene. People who had been told to get in one line were actually supposed to be in another line. Two of the lines were reversed, and though poll workers were told repeatedly, they neither directed people to switch lines nor switched places themselves. The result was chaos. People were shouting at poll workers, because they'd just spent two hours or more standing around and had plenty of time to get agitated. 

As we waited, many of the folks around me said they felt that today's mess was a sign of voter suppression. I heard at least half a dozen people say something to the effect of, "They don't want us to vote, they want us to stand here and get discouraged and walk out, but we are going to stay as long as it takes and we are going to VOTE." 

But some people did walk off the line. And others jumped the line. And we were all of us very grouchy.

I wasn't in this district four years ago, so I asked an elderly man in line behind me whether it was like this then. "No," he said. He told me that four years ago folks walked in, waited in orderly lines for ten or fifteen minutes tops, voted and walked out. "They're trying to tell us it was the storm," he said.

Anyway, I was so upset by the time I got home that I had noted the name of the supervisor, and I called up the city board of elections to complain. Do you know what they said? They said I should go back to the school and tell them to deputize me as an emergency poll worker. Which I would have done, except that place is a war zone. And I had a previous commitment, to come back here and read this thread, now showing 883 new comments since I last refreshed.

I never got my early ballot; I figured I'd forgotten to check the box for early voting when I changed my address last year. I showed up at the polling place, and had to cast a provisional ballot.

I heard from the poll workers that they'd had over sixty people saying the same thing; there was a wait for the table where people were filling out the provisional ballot forms.

Either they never got sent out, or someone went around stealing them from mailboxes.

My election day strategy: curling up in bed, watching Ghibli flicks (Arrietty right now), and pausing them every five minutes to check on the news and the Mefi because hot damn am I nervous. 

It's not just the Presidential election, though that's big. I'm worried about whether the FL justices will be kept or if Prick Scott will get a chance to ruin the courts as well. I'm worried that somehow Connie Mack will wrest Bill Nelson's seat out from under him. Nelson is a mensch.

From HuffPo. Take it for what you will:

Experts predicted record Latino voter turnout this year, and according to exit polls, they were right. CNN reported that Latino voters made up 10 percent of the overall electorate in early exit polls.

Latinos made up 7.4 percent of the overall vote in 2008, according to Pew Hispanic Center, and helped propel President Barack Obama to victory. Last time around, Obama won 67 percent of the Latino vote, and it's possible he'll win an even larger percentage this year. A tracking poll released Monday by Latino Decisions found that 73 percent of those voters support Obama, versus 21 percent who support Mitt Romney.

7:00 - Virginia - Tied

7:30 - Ohio - Obama +4

8:00 - Florida - Romney +1

8:00 - New Hampshire - Obama +3

8:00 - Pennsylvania - Obama +4

9:00 - Colorado - Tied

9:00 - Minnesota - Obama +4

9:00 - Wisconsin - Obama +4

10:00 - Iowa (wave 1) Obama +3

10:00 - Nevada (wave 1) Obama +5

wait, and that's the alleged Republican numbers? If that's true and assuming no surprise turnover, isn't it pretty much a straight-up Obama win? All of the electoral college projections I've seen seem to say that Romney pretty much had to take at least 2 of Pennsylvania/Virginia/Ohio to win.

Just got back from voting in Austin at Brykerwoods elementary. Took just under an hour, all told. They were having a computer problem when I got there, but they cleared it up after a couple minutes. Someone had kicked the power supply loose from the laptop that had the voter rolls on it, & it had finally shut down after running on battery power most of the afternoon, but they sorted it out.

The poll workers were all very pleasant & helpful, and the mood was relaxed and happy. Lots of smiles, & quite a few of us pointedly thanked them for doing a great job.

Everyone in line in front of me that I could see presented their driver's license along with ther voter's registration card, but I did not, & they didn't ask me for any more ID than that. There were 4 races that had a republican, a libertarian and a green, but no dem, so I took the opportunity to vote green in those races. Voted dem in all the races that had a dem on the ballot, & demurred in the republican & libertarian only races. Voted for all the bonds -- voted the hardest for parks!

The lady who seemed to be running the show said she'd been doing this for 10 years, and that turnout today was the highest she's ever seen. She said the line had remained steady at about an hour wait since they opened at 7 am.

Related.....when I did my registration a few weeks ago, the person I spoke with at the election board (who was really helpful and knowledgeable) also had been doing it for a couple of decades and said she had never seen this much interest in all those years. 

She suggested early voting which I did about 2 weeks ago (or something like that). I was in and out in less than 15 minutes. Took me longer to drive there than actually stand in line and vote.

I'm not sure whether it varies by polling place, but if it's like mine, you can bypass the line and chuck it in the box (not at somebody).

And will I get a sticker?

Yup. I took a Ya Voté one.

Because of the (soooo bullllshittttt) California proposition system and my need to be an informed voter, it took me about six hours of reading and research to figure out how to vote.

Exit polls are notoriously unreliable, especially early ones. There's a chance that "leak" is fake, perhaps they're hoping Obama voters will stay home.

1. The first rule of exit polls is this: Before 5 p.m., there are no exit polls. That’s when the “quarantine” lifts on the exit poll data, collected by interviewers stationed at polling places across the country, that major television networks use to project outcomes.

I am very proud that Minnesota has the largest voter turn out in the country; this amendment would give us one of the most restrictive voter policies.

Please vote no, and talk to your friends and family to make sure they know about the unintended consequences of this amendment. It might sound simple at first, but when you look closer it's clear that this is not the right choice for our state. Vote No!

Here is my Voter ID rant on FB:

The problem with saying "what's the big deal, just get an ID" is that it's just a recycled tactic to put barriers up for people who may have a harder time fighting back than you or I would. It used to be in the form of a poll tax - "what's the big deal, just pay a small tax" - except that while that seemed like not a big deal to a lot of people, it disenfranchised large swaths of people who could not even afford a small amount. Poll taxes were smacked down with the passage of the 24th Amendment to the US Constitution. The same thing happened in the form of "literacy tests" which were outlawed with the Voting Rights Act. In fact, the US has a long and ugly history of trying to keep people from voting (and a similarly long history of outlawing these tactics) based on supposed "common sense" ideas, but these are nothing but efforts to keep otherwise eligible voters from voting. Poor people and minorities are usually the most affected. Voter ID is the latest of these tactics.

Democracy is based on everyone having a voice in the process. This is something that should be protected and this is why it's different than opening a bank account or driving a car. If we want to ensure that the integrity of the electoral process is upheld, there are much better ways to do it than changing our constitution. Vote No Twice

Here's the best thing I've seen on the anti-marriage amendment, from the Vote No Twice page:

"Your vote NO on Tuesday will NOT make gay marriage legal. It will NOT force your church to perform gay weddings. It will NOT cause your hetero marriage to fall apart. It will NOT force schools to teach children about "being gay". And it will NOT make it okay for a man to marry 12 women. And nothing will EVER make it OK for me to marry my dog or you to marry your horse.

Your YES vote, however, will forever codify discrimination into the state constitution and pave the way for further erosion of your rights. It's a step backwards in time --- to when it was illegal for inter-racial couples to marry. To when it was illegal for women to vote. To when it was legal to own slaves. We've been there, done that as a society. We should be forever progressing forward as a nation.

If your reason for voting YES is because of your religion, I urge you to set that aside because we can't write YOUR religion into the constitution unless we're willing to do it for EVERYONE. And I pledge that I will fully respect your right as a religious person to only perform rites for people who ascribe to your particular dogma. I only hope that your beliefs allow for the same tolerance and acceptance."

---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my reminder that I must get over to the southside more often, I guess.

If you want to feel hope for humanity, drive the neighborhoods south of Lake Calhoun and count the Vote No signs. Don't bother counting the Vote Yes signs, there literally aren't any.

Fwiw, I've seen more churches than not with Vote No signs and messages. Both around the Uptown area, North Minneapolis and South Minneapolis. And of course the most visible church - United Methodist on Hennepin - has a very large "People of Faith Vote No" sign out front. Right across the street from the hundreds of Vote No signs outside the Walker Art Center.

10 minute wait for the booth and on my way with a He Votado Hoy sticker. They only had about a dozen of those left and all the I Voted Today were already gone. I was voter 780-ish at my location.

CBS' exit poll suggests President Obama will get 52% of the national vote. 

Specifically, they said that "thirty-nine percent said (the economy) is getting better" and that "three in four Obama voters say the economy is getting better". Do the math and that's 52% who are Obama voters.

Meanwhile, CNN apparently reported that Romney's latest internal poll of Ohio shows him trailing by 5 points in that state.

If Pence takes the governor's office, the other thing to watch is whether Republicans can get a quorum-proof supermajority in the statehouse (67 of 100 seats in the State House of Representatives; I understand it's pretty much a foregone conclusion in the State Senate). If they do, Democrats won't be able to stop "right-to-work" (anti-union) legislation with a walkout.

10 minutes to 7:00 we had an Obama guy show up at our door. I was stunned. Our houses are so far apart we don't even get any trick-or-treaters. He was about to jog off to the next house but he asked me to call two friends and then he was away into the night!

Out of all the debacle there, surely the news reporting that night was the most extremely unimportant part.

I disagree completely. I think that the media, in their hunger to get the story, get in the way and become part of the story. In 2000, NBC called Florida for Bush waaaaay too early, before a lot of polls even closed. And that sealed the fate of the election in many people's minds. It was, in reality, an undecided contest, a contested contest, but anyone on Gore's side saying so was being a sore loser because hey, NBC said Bush won!

NBC was wrong. The media outlets should STFU for the next 10 hours. We can have all this madness LATER.

My son's birth, almost exactly 10 years ago; 27 hours in a "birthing suite", emergency c-section, 3 days in the hospital,...$96,000. We had "great" insurance, and only had to pay about 10,000 of that...plus the 5+k in prenatal...and the $1000 a month insurance premiums.

That NYT map is ridiculous. 

You can't scale up early polling results to provide a state-wide prediction, because the counties reporting early will often be skewed blue or red.

But what you CAN do is report on the relative swings in those counties -- eg if traditionally weak-blue Florida counties are strong-blue, that's very significant.

For the life of me I can't understand why we aren't seeing more specific reporting on the swings in these early-reporting counties. At least in Australian elections, this is precisely what the main networks always focus on early in the night.

What does it mean that NJ is too early to call?

It means they can guess but they don't have the actual numbers. Too close to call means the count is actually close; too early to call means a definite number of votes hasn't come in yet.

If NJ is close enough that it will depend on the provisionals, then the state won't be called until the weekend.

What does it mean that NJ is too early to call?

Too early to call usually means they don't have enough returns in to make a call even if one candidate has a big lead in the returns they do have. NJ is a special case this year because of Hurricane Sandy and may not be called for days as more votes trickle in by carrier pigeon or mule rider or whatever.

It's a top down thing. Whereas the standard/traditional conception of the US government is that it's a bottom-up thing, and that the government is there to exercise the will of the people.

So at High Dudgeon School, where I get to vote. In high dudgeon. They split the lines to A-M and N-Z. They give two elector books to the poll workers corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. Apparently the N-Z's never vote. There's never a line for those fuckers. Last name Nimrod? Straight to the front. Last name Foont? To the back of the enormous line. The poll worker said to me "It's karma. You front of the alphabet folks have gotten to sit in the front of the class for all these years." I said "I don't believe in karma. I believe in stupidity. This is stupid. If there was only some way we could divide the electorate equitably! But no! Let's just split 'em down the middle alphabetically!"

Just more than three-quarters of the vote has been reported in Chesterfield County, Va., an important suburban and exurban region southwest of Richmond. In the tally so far, Mitt Romney leads President Obama 54 percent to 45 percent. If those percentages hold, Mr. Romney’s performance there would match almost exactly Senator John McCain’s margin of victory in Chesterfield County in 2008: 53 percent to 46 percent. Former President George W. Bush, however, when he carried the state in 2004, won Chesterfield County with 63 percent of the vote.

Holy crap, folks. 

538:

Just more than three-quarters of the vote has been reported in Chesterfield County, Va., an important suburban and exurban region southwest of Richmond. In the tally so far, Mitt Romney leads President Obama 54 percent to 45 percent. If those percentages hold, Mr. Romney’s performance there would match almost exactly Senator John McCain’s margin of victory in Chesterfield County in 2008: 53 percent to 46 percent. Former President George W. Bush, however, when he carried the state in 2004, won Chesterfield County with 63 percent of the vote.

— Micah Cohen


This begins to breakdown the way it did for McCain in 2008 and it bodes super well for Obama.

All those big DC suburbs are dense and will be the very last to call a winner, and in 2008 they just flowered into complete joy for the Obama folks.

Good signs though from Chesterfield County, I think.

Maybe the 538 guys should have explained how exactly one county is supposed to be an indicator for all the other counties. Because I really don't see how we can draw that conclusion.

States and county populations are reasonably demographically stable over the short term. This is not surprising: people don't suddenly (a) move en masse or (b) undergo massive ideological shifts on short notice under normal circumstances.

So if you're seeing similar outcomes and assuming similar demographies, that suggests stability in aggregate behavior over time. Which suggests (and only that, but that's interesting and significant) a general stability in the larger picture.

we are gonna finally have a Republican governor here in NC.

Jeez, Jim Martin wasn't *that* long ago.

take comfort in the fact he is a moderate Republican, the most moderate of a whole field of em back when he ran four years ago.

While it's been obvious McCrory was going to win the NC governorship for 6 months now, it's also obvious that the problem with a Republican governor in NC is that we have a Republican House and Senate that are controlled by very much non-moderate Republicans. It's delusional to believe McCrory will actually veto any of the delights those troglodytes are already planning (not that I think you believe that, St. Alia). Bottom line: NC is in for a bad time for the next two years, y'all.

Koeslitz: I didn't quite gather that from the post. Romney is winning a county McCain won, by almost the same amount, and that is good for Obama how?

Because, McCain lost VA in 2008, and I believe that fingerprint for Romney's win in ChesterField County matches what happened back then as well in that it seemed like McCain was going to win it, but soon as all those DC Suburbs voted they completely undid all the McCain numbers.

I guess, I'm hoping it's a similar profile as to how this could fall out. Romney's winning the county, BUT NOT ENOUGH, to win the state, I believe.

And if Romney can't win VA, we can further extrapolate ROmney's most likely not going to win bluer swing states...

So my spare room right now is being sublet by a guy from Sweden. About 8 pm he said he had a few questions about the election today, because it "didn't seem as big a thing" as elections in Sweden usually did, and also seemed a little less of a thing than he'd seen election day was here in 2008. I began commenting and he would then ask for more questions.

So I just spent the last 45 minutes explaining:

* The electoral college
* How Election Day is NOT a paid day off work here
* The length of House terms
* The length of Senate terms
* The function of the President vs. the Congress
* What is up with the different media channels reporting different things for results right now
* Why the results didn't quite get rolling until just now

And then I finished by telling him about the whole "Obama seeded the hurricane" conspiracy theories, which he got so amused by I think he's on his computer looking up links to send to his girlfriend in Stockholm.

Somewhat more pleasant than watching the results.

Interesting historical note: apparently ridiculous gimmicky election images are not a new thing for TV networks. In its article on the 1948 presidential election, Wikipedia says:
For its television coverage, NBC News constructed a large model of the White House containing two elephants that would pop out when NBC announced Dewey's victory; since Truman's defeat was considered certain no donkeys were placed in the White House model.

My own polling station had no stickers, but it did have a bake sale to help feed the homeless and a mixture of skin tones and religions and genders, all mixed up, at seven a.m. I have loved living in other countries, but today?

Watching everyone freak out I know that thorough, careful ballot counting as occurs in Canada and other western democracies will never work here. None of us can stand to wait a week for the complete tally. We want to know right now now now now NOW. Even if we have to agree to inaugurate Bush to get it over with.

To be fair, even with the thorough ballot counting in Canada, we have immediate results. Like to the point where they used to (still?) ban reporting on early results for fear of influencing the results out west.

Nobody else is calling it yet, but Ohio is clearly Obama's.

Take a look at Erie County, for example... the very top center of the state. 95% reporting, and it's 55%-43%, Obama... very similar to the average percentage for the state.

Take a look at Erie County in 2008. 55.7% - 42.7%. 

Oh, and MSNBC just called Pennsylvania for Obama. 

With those two states out of contention, Mitt Romney almost certainly has no route to the presidency.

My prediction for tonight: Romney loses and goes on stage without a prewritten concession speech. His logic transistors start to glitch out and his artificial retinal sensors glaze over as he begins to power down. Ryan leaps across the stage with a screwdriver and attempts to retune a few cogs in Romney's back but his giant gleaming muscles flex a bit too hard, snapping a gear. A bundle of multicolored wires eject from Romney's mouth, followed by a worn-down "Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt" Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge. Though Ryan tries the old 'blowing on the cartridge' trick, nothing can revive the Romnotron. The remaining cells of Ryan's body that are still human cause him to attempt to vomit but all that comes out is streams upon streams of pages from Ayn Rand novels. Florida votes that dogs are legally allowed to raise human babies.

Not sure how to feel about things based on these two events. I think the outcome of the presidential election will decide which one I remember. Obama wins: "remember that awesome day I saved that kitten? That was so cool (even though maybe things aren't right with the punkin')!" Romney wins: "Oh yeah, that was also the day we found out about the punkin'. What a totally shitty day that was (kitten totally forgotten)." Go Obama! Think of the children (and kittens).

538 Live blog: In every presidential election since 1960, the candidate who prevailed in Florida’s Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, has also prevailed in Florida. There is no guarantee that the pattern will hold in 2012, but the Tampa region is critical in carrying the Sunshine State (which is why the Republican Party held their national convention there this year).

More than 80 percent of the vote has been reported in Hillsborough, and President Obama leads Mitt Romney by five percentage points. Mr. Obama, as we have written, is likely getting a push from Florida’s fast-growing Hispanic community. In Hillsborough, Hispanic residents have grown by 71 percent since 2000, now accounting for a quarter of the county’s population.

Just ordered a pizza. I asked for "very liberal habaneros" because the last time I got the pizza they really skimped, for white people reasons I assume. She didn't understand what I was saying, and I thought she didn't know what 'liberal' meant. But then later I thought maybe she thought I was making some weird political comment, which re-reading doesn't seem too far fetched.

I don't know. I'm going to pick up the pizza now, I hope she doesn't fear me.

Nate Silver:

In every presidential election since 1960, the candidate who prevailed in Florida’s Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, has also prevailed in Florida. There is no guarantee that the pattern will hold in 2012, but the Tampa region is critical in carrying the Sunshine State (which is why the Republican Party held their national convention there this year).

More than 80 percent of the vote has been reported in Hillsborough, and President Obama leads Mitt Romney by five percentage points.

...am going to keep roasting vegetables until this election is called.

Listen to me, this is very important:

1) If you're going with the maple glaze, don't use a baking pan, you'll never get it clean, and your wife will hate you for ruining a baking pan. Don't use aluminum foil, or the carrots and parsnips will have little strips of inedible aluminum foil superglued to them. Use a disposable aluminum roasting pan, and a silicone flipper (not a spatula, a super-flexible, very thin/sharp, wide-surfaced flipper) to flip no fewer than THREE times, not two. Four might be better. 

2) If your guests see you snipping strips of bacon onto the veggies as part of the prep, no matter what the recipe says, you damn well better leave the bacon in there when it hits the serving dish, or questions must be answered.

In 2008 after the whole shebang was called for Obama, the husband and I went to bed (11:00?) and NC results still were not in. I think they did not declare for Obama until the next morning. So NC could be a long wait-- I'm just sayin'.

More 538 live blog: Ohio has been slow to count its vote, but President Obama has gotten reasonably strong results so far in south-central Ohio, often beating his 2008 margins there.

In Ross County, Ohio, home to the town of Chillicothe, Mr. Obama trails Mitt Romney by only one percentage point with about 80 percent of the vote counted. Mr. Obama lost the county by eight percentage points to John McCain in 2008.

Mr. Obama also leads so far in Pike County and Scioto County, two counties south of Ross County that he lost in 2008, though they have counted less of their vote at this point.

I also wish I had time to research this initiative better, but hey: I read it in the voting booth, it specified two doctors' recommendations at least 15 days apart with opportunity to rescind and a confirmed diagnosis of a terminal illness with a prognosis of less than six months to live. THat's good enough for me; in my book anyone hearing that kind of news has carte blanche to do whatever the fuck they want. 

I voted "yes" figuring that if it failed, at least there would have been a lot of visible support for it, and if it succeeded, if there are serious problems with the law it will go right to court. 

It'll go to court anyway, but I'd like to be a state that gives it a try. Enough needless suffering.

I voted "yes" figuring that if it failed, at least there would have been a lot of visible support for it, and if it succeeded, if there are serious problems with the law it will go right to court.

It'll go to court anyway, but I'd like to be a state that gives it a try. Enough needless suffering.

Good point Miko. It's reassuring to think of it that way.

This doesn't involve gay marriage or cancer patients getting stoned... it involves dead people. Sort of a big deal. Oh wells. IMO even as a bleeding heart liberal who lives in MA

I voted yes because I feel like doctors providing end of life care should be able to make decisions about pain control with patients without worrying about being imprisoned. End of life decisions are highly personal and I think should be between the doctor, patient, and family without fear of legal consequences.

Pierce on Warren:
To me, the most revelatory moment came in the last of their debates, when Warren, asked about the war in Afghanistan, said simply,"It's time to get out now." No qualifications. No relying on the generals. No crawfishing. Out. Now. A few weeks later, I was riding around with her and I told her that, as far as I knew, she was the only Democratic candidate in a contested race who has said that simple thing as plainly as she did. She popped her eyes at me in the way that she does.
Courage.

North Carolina remains close, with Mitt Romney leading by about two percentage points statewide, or 60,000 votes, with half of the vote counted. Almost all of Mr. Romney’s advantage can be explained by one county, Wake County, in North Carolina’s Research Triangle. President Obama won it by 64,000 votes in 2008. This year, Mr. Romney leads by 2,000 votes so far.

Good lord. That is a horrifying thing to say. Obama's support for that idiot Erskine Bowles' "reform" plans for social security, while leaving the Bush-era tax cuts in place, is the main reason I flipped off his name as I scribbled in the little oval. You seriously can't be serious when you seriously suggest that's the direction his "mandate" directs, right?

Question for Marie Mon Dieu: what the fuck is a Muck? (Assume my Googles are broken.)

Those are boots, actually, brand name. Like the farmers wear. I have a pair that are lavender and blue, and I was all in my fuzzy bright pink and black plaid pants, long-sleeved shirt, fleece vest, sweatshirt that says, "mess with the Moose, you get the antlers!", and a quilted-lined flannel shirt with a rather nice Pima scarf and a knitted beanie cap, behind some rather swank girls with their boot-cut slacks and shiny black leather purses. But I live at the end of a dirt road so my former days of corporate fashion are only in my closet or in books. Anyway, Mucks are like wellies, only they are guaranteed to be warm at a very cold temperature. Very ugly, however. But this is Maine, and very rural here, farm and field, so it's okay if you show up wearing your Mucks.

Fox News is so dedicated to race baiting that they're trying convince white people that minorities all vote in their own ethnic interests and that therefore they should too. 

Pretty ridiculous.

"White people" are not the problem, and have never been the problem - rich and ruthless assholes are the problem. You think that's a white issue? Check out Carlos Slim or Wen Jiabao.

I agree, but I think that its significant that a president can probably no longer be elected by simply winning the white vote and alienating everybody else

I don't know who's calling calling MO Senate for McCaskill, but with about 25% of the vote counted, it is 49.3% McCaskill to 44% Akin. The same voters went 61% Romney to 37% Obama, so it is say we're not talking about democratic strongholds here.

In short, his goose does appear to be well cooked.

FYI this is state where senatorial races tend to be decided by margins of like 49.3% to 49.2%. So even 52%-48% would be a pretty good blowout right now, especially for a dem.

Best info source is the MO Sec of State web site.

I agree to some extent, but I think there is a good argument to be made that Whiteness is the problem.

Unless you're talking about needing sunscreen I don't really think you can blame people's skin itself. 

Racism has been a big problem, but there isn't like being white makes you a racist. 

One aspect is in having a strong european-style social safety net. In the past racists would be opposed to that because they didn't want "Them" getting benefits, in comparison to countries that are more racially homogenous people feel that the ones getting benefits are like them. 

If that kind of racism goes away in the U.S, there will be much less opposition to social saftey nets. 

Which is what republicans are freaking out about. Plus the fact all their racist bullshit is killing them with Hispanics...

Obama looks like he has Florida.

Looking at the county-by-county results, and comparing turnout to 2012, it looks like there are still about 150,000 votes left in Miami-Dade (62% Obama), about 65000 votes left in Broward (68% Obama) and about 125,000 votes in Lee County (56% Romney). For counties that haven't finished reporting, I've extrapolated the missing # of votes based on 2008 turnout, and filled them in based on 2012 county-by-county voting percentages. 

As it stands, Obama should gain another 40-50k in the lead with those outstanding votes (with a current lead of 22k). Even if turnout is depressed in Miami-Dade, Obama should still win. The big question is whether Obama will win by more than 0.5% to avoid a recount. That will be very close.

Whiteness is the problem.

Unless you're talking about needing sunscreen I don't really think you can blame people's skin itself. 

Right, but when you talk about Whiteness with a capital W, it's the academic take on the social construct of Whiteness that's being called into account - not skin color. 

Maybe this is too much to get into here, but it's not being white I object to - it's what was aptly called Whiteness, and the pandering politics that seek to manipulate certain categories of strongly-identied whites in particular ways. 

I totally rejoice at the reduction of emphasis on Whiteness.

Wish I had some conservative relatives I could taunt. Haha, no I don't. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with that crap :P.
If this [DRINK HARDER] isn't the American motto, I don't know what is.
Which is why Romney never had a chance. Not drinking makes you UN-AMERICAN. 
Actually, the prior two presidents were non-drinkers, Bill Clinton and W. (at least not anymore)
Right, but when you talk about Whiteness with a capital W, it's the academic take on the social construct of Whiteness that's being called into account - not skin color.
*rolls eyes*. If you're going to talk about "Whiteness is the problem" you might want to qualify that if you don't want people to think you're some kind of anti-white racist. I mean, if someone like Bill O'Riley were out there saying "Blackness is the problem" I don't think people would hesitate to criticize him.

David Brooks is sounding resigned. . . .

Yeah, for the last hour our so he's been pretty subdued. He even said that it was becoming very very difficult for Romney to win at this point.

I don't like to see him sad. As conservatives go Brooks is an extremely solid fellow.

I think he's going to begin breathing fire though against the social issues knuckledraggers tomorrow. I can't see how any reasonable moderate Republican who's concerns are fiscal containment isn't going to be furious with the extreme God-botherers and Rapist apologists, and the homophobes, and the immigrant-haters and other bigots in their own party.

I've been talking about the demographics debacle they were creating for themselves going on 3 years now, ever since Brewer declared war on Latinos with SB 1070. And now it's here, and I feel pretty vindicated, and there is....going to be a civil war that begins in the GOtP beginning TOMORROW.

For anyone thinking Christie can't get the GOP nomination, you don't understand that the Right needs him more than he needs them...and he saw the writing on the wall.

I can't wait for the implosion. The country can't function with such a ridiculously unhealthy major party like the current GOP.

Yeah, but without the social issues, they have nothing. No one except millionaires intrinsically supports fiscal conservative B.S.

How can NBC call Minnesota with only ~15% of the precincts reporting? Sounds like they're sacrificing accuracy for speed. 

The short answer is, it's Minnesota. The long answer is their experts know the state and its demographics and can tell where things are headed from a relatively small sample.

Putting my dickwad hat on, I think where kearnyirish2 is coming from is this: women had a hand in re-electing Obama and the thing a woman likes most in life is to be proposed to and get married. So he is cursing all single women because some women preferred Obama.

My guess is he doesn't have a great sex life.

If getting him out of elected office were the only good outcome of this election, I'd be celebrating for a year of Sundays just for that alone.

What's the word on Virginia? It looks damn close there.

Per Nate Cohn at TNR:
As more votes are counted in northern Virginia, Romney's lead is down to just 20,000 votes. There are more than enough votes in northern Virginia to put the president over the top. It looks like there are about 250,000 votes left in northern Virginia.

I genuinely hope that there's at least one person somewhere out there who thinks to themself tonight, "I thought Obama was born in Kenya. I thought he was going to take away my guns and my Bible. I thought 46% of doctors would retire overnight once the health care bill was passed. I thought repealing DADT would destroy our military, and that gay marriage laws would destroy my marriage. I thought climatologists were lying about the climate, and biologists were lying about biology. And tonight I thought the polls were skewed and Mitt was going to win in a landslide. Maybe it's time that I should consider the possibility that I am completely detached from reality."

Flug's projection is 319 EVs for Obama to 219 for Romney.

It could be as high as 332/206.

Either way, basically all the swing states went for Obama and it turned out to be something of a blowout--maybe not in absolute terms but certainly in terms of expectations.

This is great. And the thing that makes me happiest, in very quick retrospect, is that it was a clean win. Consider that in 2008 Obama was reviled for things that a minister in his church may have said. His ethnicity and religion were questioned. Every charge, every possible lie and inflation about his past and background were hurled at him during the campaign and during the four years that followed.

And during this campaign, in which the opposing candidate was a member of a weird, shady, arguably non-Christian sect -- despite being the party that most needs fervent Christians to hold up the side -- nothing was said. There were times when I kind of wished the Democrats would deal dirt for dirt, and throw Romney's plygamous gold-tablet-buryin' dead-Jewish-person-converting Kobol-lovin' religion in his face and shatter the base.

Didn't happen. Didn't have to happen. Obama's a better person than I am for never going there or allowing his people to go there, even with four-plus years of solid evidence that his opponents wouldn't hesitate for a hot minute to stoop that low and lower.

It makes this so, so much sweeter. From north of the border: thanks, Obama. Thanks, America. Good call.

In Missouri we had four statewide ballot issues up for a vote. With about 2/3 of the votes counted--and many of the remaining uncounted votes from the large urban areas, so likely to skew urban/dem--here is how they are looking:

* Const. Amendment 3: Turn our model non-partisan judicial selection process into a politicized system run by the governor. Huge defeat, going down 24/76. This was a dumb proposal, I'm not really sure who was behind it. But at least Missourians have a bit of common sense once in a while . . . 

* Prop A: Return control of St Louis police department from the state to the city. It has been under state control since civil war times. Winning big, 65/35. They tried to do this in the General Assembly but it just didn't work out. The GA is dominated by rural interests but even beyond that it got caught up in legislative jockeying over tax credits. So Prop A was an end run around the GA and that can be a good thing once in a while.

* Prop B: Cigarette tax increase with proceeds going to education. Losing by 6%, 47/53. With urban areas overrepresented in the votes yet to be counted, this could squeak out a win yet, but it will be very close if it does. If I were guessing right now I would guess 49/51 loss. I thought Missourians would be a little more in favor of a sin tax but I guess we still love our ciggies just a bit too much (we're one of the top cigarette smoking states). This reminds me of the Missouri Puppy Mill Proposition in 2010, which lost in the rural areas but won big in urban areas, squeaking out a narrow victory. (Then the General Assembly went ahead and gutted it completely during its next session, but that's another story.)

* Prop E: Prohibits creation of a health insurance exchange unless created by vote of the legislature or citizen initiative. This is winning handily, 63/37. In 2010 Missourians voted 71/29 to prohibit the federal government from requiring people to have health insurance, so this is along those same lines, picking away at certain provisions of Obamacare.

Source for current vote totals is Missouri Sec of State.

But it's not the same place. Life is a river. One of the reasons smarty pants Obama won is that the demographics of the 2000 election have changed. Obama read that river and was paddling with the current while Romney was on the shore having a BBQ with the white folks who would have carried him to the White House a dozen years ago. And I believe people are still lined up in Florida to vote and say "fuck you" to the people who tampered with their votes in the 2000 election. That is so awesome, and you are so fortunate to have Barack Obama as your president. Congratulations!

Washington voters were saying yes to the state’s same-sex marriage measure, echoing apparent victories in other states with gay-marriage measures on the ballot.

Referendum 74 was leading in initial vote counts Tuesday night 53 percent to 47 percent. In King County, it was ahead 65 percent to 35 percent.

If the law ultimately passes, it would take effect Dec. 6.

Voters in Maine and Maryland were also approving gay-marriage laws, and in Minnestota, they were rejecting a constitutional ban against it.

And during this campaign, in which the opposing candidate was a member of a weird, shady, arguably non-Christian sect -- despite being the party that most needs fervent Christians to hold up the side -- nothing was said. 

The funny thing is there *were* attacks on Romney's faith -- but pretty much all of it was from other campaigns and influential figures inside the GOP. It's even possible that lingering anti-Mormonism on that side of the fence made the difference in Romney not quite getting the turnout he needed in key places.

And meanwhile, on the other side of the fence, the worst thing I can remember being said was Reid's accusation that Romney wasn't a particularly good Mormon.

I'm going to be pointing this out to my Mormon friends/family.

Their anger and disappointment is turning on him and pretty soon, like a rabid zombie herd on The Walking Dead, they're slowly realizing the must tear him apart.

From Fox Business ("The Power to Prosper"):

Another theory making the rounds on Election Day was that a win by Obama would mean four more years of loose fiscal policy, a boon for stock markets. Romney has said he would not appoint Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to another term. Bernanke is the architect of the loose monetary policies that have dominated the U.S. economy since the 2008 fiscal crisis.

Yeah, that's right.... it was a tight ship until 2008.

He did say some really dumb stuff earlier about how the President will need to cooperate with the other party to get things done. My wife and I both pointed out to our TV screen that the other party also needs to cooperate, because if only one side is trying to cooperate while the other refuses to do anything unless they get their way, it's a rather abusive relationship.

I made the mistake of flipping over to Fox News to get my freude schadened. Megyn Kelly is trying to make this into a story about how Obama ran a negative campaign, and what this portends for elections in the future.

She did this while sitting in a studio in which she can probably still smell the festering pork juices and Old Spice aroma of Karl Rove, who accused John McCain of having a black baby and slandered a Vietanm war hero.

And she did it on the #1 cable news network in America.

Yeah, here's the e/mail from Obama:


Robert -- 

I'm about to go speak to the crowd here in Chicago, but I wanted to thank you first.

I want you to know that this wasn't fate, and it wasn't an accident. You made this happen.

You organized yourselves block by block. You took ownership of this campaign five and ten dollars at a time. And when it wasn't easy, you pressed forward.

I will spend the rest of my presidency honoring your support, and doing what I can to finish what we started.

But I want you to take real pride, as I do, in how we got the chance in the first place.

Today is the clearest proof yet that, against the odds, ordinary Americans can overcome powerful interests.

There's a lot more work to do.

But for right now: Thank you.

Barack

You may be more right than you realize.

I'm sure Mitts is apoplectic, catatonic, furious, and going all through the angles repeatedly, to see if there's any daylight at all in the case that Obama won, that might allow some wiggle room or some way to game it.

He could get really brutal and corporate and be a total bastard, just for the heck of it.

But as Mark Shields said on PBS, he really needs to think about how he wants to be remembered in history, at this point, and it's important he realizes how important it is to concede properly and be graceful.

Also making a BIG FUKKIN DEAL that Obama will be the first President who won re-election with fewer EVs and with a very narrow Pop Vote superiority.

And Mitt just basically never got heard, and it was symbolic of the end of waiting around for these delusional, science-hating, data and nate silver hating, homophobic, women oppressing assholes who are holding the country back from being freaking awesome.

Some comments and observations:
- I voted early as I was working today and pretty much non-stop. It was like there was a party going on at City Hall, with a bunch of people there casting early votes. There was a mother who was trying to take pictures with her camfone of her daughter, who was casting her first vote. They seemed so happy, so I took a picture of them together in front of City Hall, holding on to their "I Voted" sticker, and then they insisted on doing the same for me. It was very sweet, and they just seemed so damn happy!
- A lot of the minority population there and in the city I work in remembered some of the tricks from the last election. They were offering advice to each other and talked about going overkill to ensure that they will be able to cast their vote: bring backup forms of ID, ensure your address was correct, print out your full, legal name on absentee ballots, take no "free buses/rides" to wrong voting centers. They seemed to be much more aware of how to make their vote count.
- The hospital I work at serves a very poor tax base and is predominantly black. Most were not aware that they and their families could cast their vote easily even up to the days immediately preceding election day. People were just not aware, but I made them aware that they could still vote (rest assured, I approached this neutrally, asking if they wanted to vote, and informing them that they could exercise their right to vote, and that I am not advocating any candidate and that I would not know who they would vote for-- I would only sign the line certifying that they qualified as they were hospitalized, or that they would not be able to make it to the voting center and that their primary caregiver could also qualify).
- So I just gave them the information from the official virginia.gov site, and ended up signing some forms.

Did this make a difference for Norfolk and Portsmouth, VA? I don't know. But I think it's important to remember that people can do this in future elections, and that regardless of who you might think someone's going to vote for, it's important to remind them that they are able to exercise their right to vote.

On another note, it's also worth mentioning that subjectively this seemed to make people feel better. Like they're not just sick people stuck in a hospital, but that they're part of their community, society, and country as a whole. It made them feel better.

So if you work in a health-care setting, or find yourself sick, or caring for a sick person, tell your friends. Tell your family. Tell EVERYONE. Voting is important, but letting people feel like they can do things "normal" (ie: not sick) people can do is immeasurably heartening.

Romney should just send Ryan out to concede, he's never had the stomach to do his own wetwork.

I remember when McCain gave his concession speech, Palin barged in and gave a concession speech of her own which is really not done. People were a bit shocked but as usual for Palin it was All About Her and it was clear she was trying to set up her people for a future Palin Victory. Although in hindsight it is more like a future Palin Super PAC that would support her in the style to which she had become accustomed to.

> Heard on CNN that the popular vote count has shrunk to less than a 500 vote difference. Three-hundred-something difference with both candidates at over 49 million votes each. Not three hundred thousand, three hundred.

And here's where I tell this story. The last time I voted was in 2000, at the age of 18. I was just so disillusioned by the whole thing, that I sat everything out for 12 years. I came up with a bunch of convincing (but obviously flawed) arguments as to why voting isn't worth it.

Anyway, 12 years go by. I don't know what the tipping point was exactly, but dammit. I'm sick of anyone who doesn't look or act the way I do being treated as less than a person. I just can't take it anymore.

So, I showed up to vote today, by waking up at 6 AM and getting to the polling place 15 minutes before they opened. I was voter number 8 at my particular place. And while Texas overwhelmingly goes red, I didn't care. I actually showed up today, I gave a shit, I did what I was supposed to do. My singular vote probably didn't matter. That's not the point. The point is showing up and saying, "I'm here, I care about people, and this is who I think should be running things." That's what it's about. Living in a place where you have that power, and the power to actually exercise that is why you should vote. /end story

Importantly, in MN a blank vote on the amendments is counted as a "no". Including the blanks, both amendments are running over 50% no. Still a slim lead then, and hoping it doesn't change... The Bachmann race is killing me, so freakin' close!

Here's a question: given the margin to which Latinos and the young went to Obama, what is the high-level Republican strategy for the next 4-8 years? The demographics for their current base looks bad, so where do they go from here? I don't think a swing (even farther) to the right in social issues is going to help them, as it does not seem like younger Latinos are as serious about abortion and the like as their parents and grandparents are.

So there I was thinking that mostly that was a more positive speech than it could have been, but... really? You left it on the field, and gave it all? You're gonna go home to one of your mansions, and you have the gall to say that?

I mean, a big chunk of his problems came from never really committing to running for President. I'm very fucking far from an expert on becoming President, but even I know that if I want to run in 2012, I need to start generating utterly boring tax returns no later than 2000. But Romney kept choosing his zillions of dollars over really running for President.

So, tonight driving home from voting we heard The President speaking on the radio, and my son (he's six) leaned forward in his seat "Is that Obama? is that what his voice sounds like?" and I realized we keep him so sheltered from media that he'd never actually heard The President speak. So at dinner I showed him the video of the 'Yes We Can' speech from 2008. He was mesmerized, and I realized that I still believe in hope. 

"There is something happening when Americans who are young in age and in spirit - who have never before participated in politics - turn out in numbers we've never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different.

There is something happening when people vote not just for the party they belong to but the hopes they hold in common - that whether we are rich or poor; black or white; Latino or Asian; whether we hail from Iowa or New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction. That is what's happening in America right now. Change is what's happening in America.

You can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness - Democrats, Independents and Republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded Washington; who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable; who understand that if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that's stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better, there's no problem we can't solve - no destiny we cannot fulfill.

Our new American majority can end the outrage of unaffordable, unavailable health care in our time. We can bring doctors and patients; workers and businesses, Democrats and Republicans together; and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that while they'll get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair. Not this time. Not now."

Speaking of prediction, Sam Wang got 49/50 correct as far as I can tell (assuming FL is truly for Obama) and in his prediction acknowledged FL was basically a coin toss. Also he predicted Obama was a heavy favorite back in August, with the actual outcome pretty close to the middle of the 1-sigma CI (here).

On the other hand, statisticians are short effeminate men who pander to the "far-left", so in conclusion fuck data, let's make shit up.

We're still wasting lives and money and futures in Afghanistan. We're still murdering Afghan and Paki civilians at an ever increasing rate by remote control. We're still on the hook for any future failure of a fundamentally unreformed banking system. We're still a prison industrial nation.

Heller (R) is up 46/45 (up 6300 votes) in NV, is 92% of the vote counted.

Obviously, both close races that could swing either way still.

The Electoral College is fucked up enough as is, with the disparity in individual voting power between (say) California and Wyoming; American Samoa has like a tenth the population of Wyoming.

Puerto Rico, on the other hand, would be basically a medium state in terms of population.

I'm not as big a fan of that idea as I am of the Puerto Rico idea. I mean, I'm not completely opposed, but those places have tiny populations. The Electoral College is fucked up enough as is, with the disparity in individual voting power between (say) California and Wyoming; American Samoa has like a tenth the population of Wyoming.

There's thought that the various U.S.-associated Pacific islands could be admitted as a single state. See this section on the Wikipedia article on "51st State."

Under Romney, she'd be screwed and would have set her back significantly.

I'm happy about this, happier than I thought I would be. The overall makeup of Congress hasn't shifted in numbers much, but Aiken is out, Brown is out, Warren is in, Alan Greyson is back, so aside from Obama winning, there are some genuinely positive signs showing from this election. Gay marriage and medical marijuana have won in...I forget where. It's a perfect storm of too much information.

That said, I'm not in tears. I didn't cry four years ago and I'm not crying now. Obama is a politician, and I feel no guilt in being a wet blanket to the festivities and remind folks that Obama is very cozy with Wall Street, is silent on medical marijuana, is open to more (pointless) drilling of public lands, and a number of other issues that the "left" (though breaking that down you'll find it's actually most people) favors.

I've been tempering my criticism of Obama with "give him a chance, wait til the second term." Now I start my stopwatch and start checking off my clipboard. Now Obama has just four more years to make some significant stances that the left favors, and now he needs to stop with this "bipartisan" conciliation with people who have no plans to ever work with him. He needs to get angry, starting tomorrow.

We can all get drunk tonight, but the reason I am happy is only partly that Obama won; I'm probably more happy that Romney and the GOP lost so much.

In 2008, I had a 5-year-old and a 2-year-old. But even then, it wasn't about my children, because they were still babies in my mind, not individuals who would eventually be adult human beings with needs and wants and rights. But now, now that I have a 9, 6, and not-quite-2-year old, especially with the older two very much being individuals, I am in tears. I'm looking at my sleeping children, and I am so grateful to have a President who cares about THEM, no matter their economic status, no matter their social status ... I am in tears. He actually cares, not just about the next four years, but about the fourty and fourty and fourty years after that.

I'm going to give you the update on Missouri. Which can now start going by its new moniker, "The Schizo State".

Romney (R) leads Obama by 11%.

McCaskill (D) leads Akin by nearly 15%.

Governor Jay Nixon (D) won re-election by 11%.

Lt. Gov. Peter Kinder (R) won re-election by 5%.

It looks like the dems are sweeping the remaining 3 statewide offices (Sec of State, Treasurer, Att. General). One of those is maybe too close to call yet. Auditor elections are held on off years and the Auditor is currently R.

So statewide we have 6 offices total, 3 D, 2 R, 1 too close to call.

Senators: 1 D (McCaskill), 1 R (Blunt).

So, can we agree that there is some degree of parity there between the two parties? Sometimes Ds win by 5-10 points, sometimes Rs win by 5-10 points. Sometimes one or the other wins by 1-2 points. But clearly, BOTH parties are capable of winning statewide elections. This isn't a lopsided, one-party state, but a more-or-less parity state.

Now let's look at the state General Assembly--because that is where the schizophrenia sets in.

In a state where there is some degree of parity between the two parties at the statewide level, you'd expect the same in the state House and Senate, wouldn't you?

Nope.

As of today, the Republicans hold VETO-PROOF majorities in BOTH the House and the Senate.

Rs already held a veto-proof majority in the Senate, and it looks to me like they picked up one additional seat today.

Rs previously held a nice majority in the House, but today they picked up several more seats and now hold a 110/53 majority.

Why?

In short, geography. Most dem voters are packed conveniently into dense cities, so they put them all into nice, compact districts that are 80-90% dem.

Republicans dominate the exurbs and rural areas, so they arrange those districts with a few small towns (which tend more dem) to make 55-60% R districts. 

Result is that a roughly equal number of R and D voters in the state translate into a General Assembly completely dominated by Rs.

Oh, and I forgot to mention that as of today, 6 of 8 of Missouri's U.S. House members are R. (Previously it was 6 of 9.) 

So a 50/50 electorate (or 60/40 if you want to give the Rs the greatest possible benefit of the doubt) translates into majorities ranging from 67/33 to 75/25 for the Rs in the state senate, state house, and U.S. House.

Wondering why the House is still held by Rs when a D president won a EV landslide and a majority of the popular vote?* States like MO are the reason.

One reason I'm pointing this out is that I'm guessing a number of states face similar situations. We've got to figure out how to win not just national, but local races. We've got to figure out how to win hearts and minds not just in the cities but in the suburbs, small towns, and countryside, too. A lot of that dark money isn't winning things at the national level, where the hard light of media exposure evens the playing field somewhat. But it's buying a hell of a lot in smaller local races and at the statewide level, where lots more flies right under the radar.

What makes exceptional are the bonds that hold together the most diverse nation on Earth, the belief that our destiny is shared. That this country only works when we accept certain obligations to one another, and to future generations, so that the freedom which so many Americans have fought for and died for comes with responsibilities as well as rights, and among those are love, and charity, and duty, and patriotism. That's what makes America great.

And I can't imagine it ever happening on, say, Hardball.

My favorite bit was the very end when Matthews says that Obama needs to thank his party and fellow Democrats and build a coalition to defeat the Republicans head on and Maddow says she thinks that's something not for tonight but for Wednesday. And Matthews says, half under his breath, that with Obama he's been waiting for Wednesday for four years and it never seems to arrive.

...and then the long knives came out for Mitt Romney.

"Today, Tea Party Patriots, the nation’s largest tea party organization, criticized the Republican Party for hand-picking a weak, Beltway elite candidate who failed to campaign forcefully on America’s founding principles – and lost. . . What we got was a weak moderate candidate, hand-picked by the Beltway elites and country-club establishment wing of the Republican Party. The Presidential loss is unequivocally on them."

Shame that the Tea Party didn't let their people know what a lousy candidate Mitt Romney was, ideally sometime before they were praising him effusively. 

Gee... I sure do hope that the GOP, in their effort to move more towards a rational centrist position, doesn't provoke a split with the Tea Baggers, as that could divide the Republican Party and make them unelectable for years and years.

I just wanted to relate a quick story: a right-leaning family member of mine, somewhat in shock after the concession, asked why I was glad Obama won. I outlined the basics as clearly and as calmly as I could, explaining I would have considered voting for Mass. Governor Mitt Romney, but not 2012 GOP Primary Mitt Romney. I also explained how I felt the same way about John McCain in 2000 vs 2008, and that my opinion was that the increasing extremism on the far right was beginning to corrupt the rest of the party.

Then I told her everything would be fine. No millionaires are going to flee because their taxes went up a hair. Obamacare is a good thing, and more people who truly need help will get help because of it, and we can pay for health care if we aren't spending all of our money on tax cuts for the wealthy and wars overseas.

Now, I doubt she's going to go put a Obama/Biden sticker on her car tomorrow, but she did seem more relieved than resigned. Perhaps more important than gloating tomorrow at the water cooler is being gracious, extending our hand across the painted chasm between the red and blue, and letting them know that everything is going to be okay.

I believe that allowing the Bachmanns of the Republican party to expose themselves as the angry partisans with bizarre agendas while maintaining our own composure will not only help the Democrats, but also the Republicans. As long as we can get back to agreeing on basic rights for everyone and leaving the disagreement in some of the details, I would welcome spirited debates that don't involve religious decrees about who can have sex with whom, or why women are forced to give up the sovereignty of their bodies because some holy men think it's the right thing to do. Get the facade of religion out of the equation, and let's start talking instead of allowing one tiny part of the GOP to shout the rest of the country down.

Who's going to replace Obama? We've only got four more years to decide.

Please let it be a woman. Someone strong, intelligent and cutthroat, but also compassionate. Someone who stands up for the rights of all people. 

Perhaps an Atheist woman.

It did close up after the first debate. Before that, there was basically no chance. Check out the graph on 538. Look especially at the "now cast" tab which shows who would have won if the election were that day. Obama was almost at 100%, then dropped down to like 60%. 

Of course, a 60/40% chance is actually pretty close, but the chances for Romney deteriorated quickly after that.

Not that we choose those who sat close to power first.

Oh Redstate.com, let me lick your salty salty tears:

"Romney didn't have the balls to challenge Obama in the third debate over Libya, or the spread of Al Qaeda and other Muslim terrorists groups other than mentioning it in passing, or even challenge Obama's assertion that he had great relations with Israel, or make a major issue over "Fast and Furious". Now there will be no repeal of Obama Care. The unions will be stronger than ever with forced card check, Israel will be sacrificed for the democratic party's slavish devotion to Palestine and the Arabs. Romney and the GOP didn't have the balls to take on Obama's handling of Hurricane Sandy. Just play it safe and hope to cruise to success. Don't call Obama and his party out for what they are--hard core Marxists, who have trampled all over the constitution. Now these low-lives can crawl out from under their rocks and safely return to their Muslim sympathies, their use of the Orwellian euphemism called "climate change" as one of their many ruses to further undermine our national sovereignty to subordination to a one world government, and to deliberately undermine our efforts an energy independence. Most importantly, with control of the Senate, Obama will have a field day nominating every kind of Marxist judge imaginable for the next four years."

(I am hoping the tears are not infectious).

Yglesias on Slate, and the Guardian in its editorial point out a very salient fact that I haven't thought about before: that, at least since the onset of the Great Recession, there's a certain anti-incumbency factor in elections worldwide. Obama is one of the very few OECD leaders to have beaten the trend now.

(One thesis from Keynesians - probably Krugman - is that political volatility actually increases as recessions grind on, to take Japan's experience in the 1990's)

> Huzzah, Colorado and Washington (and boo to Oregon). Historic!

Oregon's law was poorly written and not very well funded on the ballot.

The ballot measure itself even had the costs section at $22 million, while the projected revenue generated (easily estimated at $160 million) was pretty much "I dunno, a lot of money?" This was what was sent out in the flyer about the bill. I hope that the fact that it got 46% of the vote as I am writing this, and that WA now has it legalized across the border, a better bill will come up next year or in 2014.

I helped Hilary's campaign the first time around and I'll do it again if she runs, but she's going to be, what, 68? She's expressing an extreme desire to retire, so I doubt she'll do it.

I would vote for Michelle, but I think the Obamas would probably benefit to just being a family after these four years. Campaign trails and presidencies are difficult, AND they have young children. Can you imagine eight years of that? Because you know she'd get a second term.

Julian Castro. Perhaps he will be Hillary's veep pick before going for the big one, but I doubt it. I expect he will run for something else in 2012. I'd love to see Hillary as president or even just the D canidate, but I don't think she has another 8+ years of this business in her.

Michelle Obama is wonderful, but has she ever actually expressed political ambition on her own, apart from just not doing the Nancy Reagan/Laura Bush apolitical First Lady thing? It was pretty apparent starting when Clinton was governor that Hills fully expected on and planned to hold office in her own right at some point.

This is a good point as well, per Ezra Klein: that, regardless of anything else, Obama's second term will be about consolidating at least two things from Obama '08: healthcare and restoring tax rates for the rich. 

That in itself is a victory, although it'll be nice to have senate reform, democracy reform and something for climate-change as well, at the very least.

Obscure ballot measures news, transit edition: 
Mixed news for transit-related ballot measures as far as I can tell. Alameda County (Oakland, Berkeley) CA approved a half-cent sales tax for transit; extending the BART system into suburban/exurban Livermore and increasing bus service. Orange County (Chapel Hill) NC approved a 1/2 cent sales tax for transit as well, which will connect them to light rail in Durham.

Virginia Beach had a nonbinding referendum on extending the successful TIDE light rail system from Norfolk into VA Beach, which passed with 62% support. In Honolulu, the mayoral candidate who wanted to halt construction of the city's first light rail transit line is losing by a significant amount. 

On the down side, in Houston, a referendum passed that forces the transit agency to keep handing over some of the sales tax revenue it collects to the various cities in the area; this will make further rail expansion unlikely. Memphis voted down a 1 cent gasoline tax for transit as well. 

Perhaps the most important referendum is in Los Angeles, where voters are choosing whether to extend a sales tax used for funding transit; if it passes, then a funding deal where the county borrows money to build a hell of a lot of transit now (with low interest / high unemployment) and pays it off with the guaranteed sales tax is possible. This could be a landmark in major city transit funding, and would something like double the amount of urban rail in LA over then next 15 years. It's at 65% approval, with 38% of the precincts reporting. Sadly, it needs 2/3 majority to pass.

Quite the opposite. She was only grudgingly accepting of Barack's political career at the outset, and his losing that first election almost cost their marriage. Michelle is of course a wonderful spouse and excellent for Obama's image, but she is by no means a political operator in her own right, nor is it something to which she aspires.

What's particularly great is how obviously wrong Rove is. At the time, Obama had a 30K vote lead; the final result was a 100K vote lead. The only counties that had a disproportionate share of votes still outstanding at that point were mostly Cuyahoga (Cleveland) and Lucas (Toledo), Obama's strongest and third strongest counties in Ohio. Rove is talking about 991 votes, which must have been even earlier - the margin had already gone from 991 to 30,000 and Shitbeak Q. Turdface couldn't possibly imagine how Obama could win.

Great words from Josh Marshall here

The most concrete thing that strikes me about this public verdict is that Health Care Reform, Obamacare, a system of near universal coverage that will provide a framework for future reform, is here for good.

It withstood the challenge of the conservative judiciary. It survived a national referendum. As Bill Kristol wrote memorably back in late 1993, the reason conservatives fought this so hard is because they knew that once it was in place the public would never let it be taken away. And it won’t. It’s here for good. That alone would seal President Obama’s legacy.

We also rejected a measure to remove some segregationist language from our state constitution by a wide margin, though that may be a blessing in disguise as many on the left here (such as it exists) argued it was crafted in order to stealthily undermine a right to public education.

On the bright side, our opportunistic sheriff, who after years as a Democrat jumped ship to the GOP as part of their plan to capture county courthouses statewide (the last Democratic stronghold here), lost to our longtime incumbent probate judge 60-40.

It's worth noting that so far Citizens United has simply enabled rich assholes to waste a lot more money

I'll point out (again) that the approx. $1 billion in dark money, 81% of which went to Republicans, may well have stopped Obama from reaching 400 EVs, the Senate from gaining 2, 3, 5 or some other number more Ds, and the House from swinging D or at least a lot closer to it.

And it certainly had an influence on downballot races, redistricting, and a lot of other shenanigans that have gone in the recent past. Just for example here in Missouri a rich guy funded a recent successful ballot initiative that is basically a poison pill for city income tax in our two largest cities, cleverly designed to not look like that.

"Great," you're saying, "lower taxes for all!"

Um just finished reading that Pierce I linked and holy fuck does he end this mess as he started, w/ a TL;DR borne on the wings of angels or some such:

The long creative project of America has been to engage all its citizens in that work. That is the history that he wears so well, and that he wields so subtly. That is the truth that he represents. That is the great silent thing that has been there through all the debates, and the ads, and all of that preposterous money. We are working on ourselves. We are incomplete. We are never finished. Elections come and go. The political commonwealth is a work in progress. We work with the tools that time and circumstance provide. As he enters his final term, with the elegiac music playing out there in the distance, Barack Obama will use the history that he has come to embody and, perhaps, even to fulfill, as part of a larger project that never will be completed but only finished, over and over again.

axiom: "The question is what hurdles are put up to receive said ID card. Voter ID laws are tricky because they seem prima facie reasonable if you don't consider that in-person voter fraud isn't a problem to begin with."

Yeah, agreed it's not an urgent problem the way some Republicans make it out to be. I'm definitely against laws that require voter ID where it's hard to get such an ID.

I just don't think requiring voter ID is necessarily a real problem either, so long as it's done right. When we vote in Canada, we need ID, but everyone already has one. Yay free medicare cards! I'd be ok with US states having a similar system.

Doesn't the amendment require that the state government provide everyone an ID card, gratis? That makes this sound more legitimate than voter-suppression-y.

AFAIK, the amendment didn't spell out any specifics about how any of the ID stuff was to be implemented, leaving it up to the legislature to figure out. It would have turned into a giant clusterfuck as the parties battled over all of those details.

#1. I predicted McCaskill would trounce Akin by 10-15%. FINAL ANSWER: 15.5% drubbing, Akin runs home with tail between legs.

#2. I predicted Obama would win with 319 or 332 EVs. FINAL ANSWER: With FL, O takes it with 332 EVs.

That's right, we have the highest voter turnout, the longest unbroken streak of voting for democratic candidates for president, and we've defeated the homophobes and helped bring an end to their winning streak."

As you allude, Minnesota is now the first state ever to reject one of these hateful anti-marriage amendments at the polls. It looks like Bachmann has won in the Sith District, but it looks like everything else is going swimmingly here -- DFL control of the Legislature, both amendments got rejected, Cravaack got unelected...

Lost in the shuffle here is the fact that voters in Iowa re-elected Justice David Wiggins, who was instrumental in writing the decision that ushered in gay marriage in that state. He had faced huge opposition from Christian-right groups, and if he had lost, the law likely would have been challenged and struck down. So another piece of good news is that gay marriages will continue in the Field of Dreams and other scenic places around Iowa!

I think the total spending was something like $3 billion- $1b from each campaign and $1b in dark/PAC money. ~116m votes counted as of now puts it at about $25 a vote. Much lower if you are in a "safe state", much, much higher if you aren't.

Lost in the shuffle here is the fact that voters in Iowa re-elected Justice David Wiggins, who was instrumental in writing the decision that ushered in gay marriage in that state. He had faced huge opposition from Christian-right groups, and if he had lost, the law likely would have been challenged and struck down. So another piece of good news is that gay marriages will continue in the Field of Dreams and other scenic places around Iowa!

Of all the ridiculous direct-democracy experiments that US has had this election season, thought that this was the most unfair. The second most ridiculous election was for that bridge from Michigan to Windsor, Ontario, where the Canadian consul general found himself campaigning for a bridge that Canada was going to pay for.

Glad America voted against both these forms of lunacy!

Congrats people. I'll leave you with the new American epic of #RomneyDeathRally
The #RomneyDeathRally is now real. The blood gates have opened.

“A faceless quivering mass has taken Missouri. Please, take shelter in your homes.” Then the feed went out.

Romney raises his hands as pillars of fire frame the stage. “We have such delightful things to show you!”, he bellows at #RomneyDeathRally

A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings….all disguised within a single man

“Those lucky enough to have your lives, take them with you. However, leave the ballots you’ve lost. They belong to me now.”

“Can you smell it?!” Paul Ryan screams at the assembled. “Can you smell your fear made flesh?!”

“Hollow, hollow,” the crowd wails, “The Romney’s laughter fills us, but we are hollow.”

Glenn Beck gibbers insanely after his lips and eyelids have been removed as punishment for his failures

“You will grovel,” Romney demanded to the woman, “Or suffer The Binder!” The crowd chants: “The Binder!”

Mitt opens one in front of us; it alights to pray on the women. He has boxes more, & they will feed…

Lo, the NecRomnomicon was opened and six upon six women sprung from the binder, declared to be First Wives of Armageddon...

In an awkward coincidence, Meatloaf is devoured by a bat out of hell.

Sarah Palin bursts into tears, which immediately burst into flames at #Romneydeathrally. Her hair grows, emerging as screeching crows.

A ghastly pale moon, enormous and pockmarked, rises behind Romney as Rush Limbaugh disrobes onstage.

In his moon base Newt sips a martini as he continues to watch the devastation spread. “Pity… I liked some of them”

Romney whispers in gutteral tones, echoed by the mewling hordes: “Where we’re going, we don’t need eyes to see”

Romney plunges his hands into the flames. Feels incredible power. But he has not cast the right spells. Dark gods laugh.

He falls on his knees. “Give me Ohio and my sons will serve you.” The earth shudders. Ravens circle the Cleveland skyline.

A thousand souls at Fox News cry out in horror as the ritual goes dreadfully wrong

“The swing states do not swing,” Romney gibbers. “With no pendulum, whither the denizens of the pit?!”

Rupert Murdoch crushes dozens beneath his massive paws as he stomps onto stage. “VOTER FRAUD!” he screams! “It’s all fraud!”

Drones draw closer to the scene, payloads ready to wipe the grisly scene from the face of the earth

“I can be slain by no man,” Romney bellows, breath of rot and sulfur. Hillary Clinton raises her sword. “I am no man!”

Romney grins “what would save YOU, mortal?” Obama smirks and hits the button “Co-workers.” The sky darkens with drones…

Tears of bubbling pitch fall from Romney’s eyes. He wipes them with a hundred dollar bill. The fire melts skin off bones

Briefcase bulging with unmarked ballot papers, Ryan shouts over his shoulder, “Ruuun! Get to the choppa!”

Obama surveys the wasteland,”He hasn’t given a concession yet”. Biden snorts,”Hell, he still hasn’t given tax returns”

As the sun rose, all who had touched the hem of his robe became translucent, fading, melting away.

I hate to rain on your parade guys, but 538 still shows Obama with a 90.9% chance of winning; it isn't over yet. Or may be Nate Silver is in denial like all the other conservatives and still thinks there is a slim chance Romney can pull this out in the Supreme Court or something.

Or maybe he just doesnt update his graphs after the election.

There is something deeply satisfying about watching Nate Silver's facts and math and stats coming true, as other went with their gut feelings or just feelings in general. Romney was so impressed by the large crowd that greeted him in Ohio that he felt he was going to win.

I decided to take the high road and aim for a teaching moment in my reply:

We'll probably see high gas prices, but that's due to worldwide forces and is beyond the control of any one country's government. Obama may put an end to the Bush tax cuts for wealthy, but that's a good thing. We are not likely to see an Obama-led WWIII. Obama has had to deal with the two wars Bush started, but he hasn't started any himself and was against invading Iraq as a senator. And I don't believe anyone who voted for Obama is ever going to think he or she was "dumb" for doing so. He hasn't been the president I hoped he would be, but better him any day than a man who claims that women can't get pregnant from being raped.

My guess is she'll delete it.

The one thing that really surprised me was Akin losing. Not because he's loathsome, but because Missouri is full of loathsome and Claire McCaskill has a history of being the second least exciting campaigner in the world. She barely managed to beat Jim Talent for his first term. Jim Talent is probably a hipster, because he was extremely Tea Party well before you heard of them.

But not only did she win, she utterly crushed Akin -- 55 - 40, in a state which went to Romney 54-44. Interesting enough, 6% went Lib. So, apparently, even the GOP wouldn't vote for this guy.

So, kids -- carefully note *every* time a GOP'er supports rape, and play that tape hard come October, 2014.

2014 kids, not 2016. All the house, 1/3rd the senate. Worry about 2016 after that one.

McCaskill is probably as personally responsible for last night as anyone not named Barack Obama. She chose Akin in the GOP primary, running ads in support of him. Risky, but paid off: His legitimate rape implosion set a very pro-Dem narrative for months and massively dragged down the party nationally when it really mattered (and in places where it really mattered).

She's also great on TV. She's a bit to eager to be Lieberman, but in terms of pure politcking she's very good at this.

Pundits on the radio seemed surprised about Glenda Ritz winning Superintendent of Public Instruction, but I've seen a lot of heartfelt lobbying for her on Facebook and other Internet forums. I wonder if there's a "Facebook effect" polls don't capture? (I don't mean trivia like how many "likes" a candidate has -- that takes no effort -- but any ripple effect of posting a personal plea.)

So I've now had the SECOND major fight with one of my best friends over an election; the Green Party friend, who got all Eeyore about how "don't you dare say Obama's a good guy because there's no difference between him and the republican guy" and such in 2008 and again last night; this year, just like 4 years ago, I finally snapped and shouted at him to back the fuck off and give it a rest for JUST a few hours for a change whydoncha...we made up quickly, just like we did last time, but I still hate it when that happens.

But then this morning I went to get a car to work (running late) and got picked up by an off-duty yellow cab. Older couple in their 60's in front, West Indian accents; the guy was just starting his shift, and bringing his wife to work. We got in, and after a few seconds, the wife asked if she minded if she asked if I'd voted, and who I voted for. I told them Obama, and she said "congratulations." Then she giggled and said "good, you're with us!" And we had a lovely conversation the whole way, but I had more fun just basking in both of their good will; they just seemed so happy. They even said that Romney's concession speech was gracious.

Just to clarify, the ads that McCaskill ran “in support” of Akin basically said – Tea partiers! I, Claire McCaskill, am warning you: Don’t vote for Akin in the primaries! He’s just TOO DARN CONSERVATIVE! He can’t possibly win!

So of course the far right immediately turned out for him in the primaries. It was a very clever move because, well ... she wasn’t lying.

really wanted Obama to win because he's the better man for it. 

However today after my neandrathal boss told me that women with views about women's rights like mine(pro-choice etc etc ) will be considered barbarians in 100 hundred years and went on and on and on about how he knows American politics and Romney was going to win and told me I was stupid when I said I thought he was wrong and then proceeded to LECTURE me about men and women in politics (basically we're not smart enough to understand like the mens do) and then said NO YOU STAY HERE AND LISTEN when I chose to walk away instead of continuing and having to quell my urge to punch him and walk out of my job... I want Obama to win so I can go to work and say "Hey I told yah"

Stipulate that (a) we don’t have a national election but 50 state elections, and (b) they are still counting votes so the final popular vote for both candidates will be bigger than it is now. Still seems very significant that Obama is 10 million votes short of where he was in 2008.

Ha ha, Krugman sings my favorite song of fuckyou:


OK, somewhat more seriously: one big thing that just happened was that the real America trumped the “real America”. And it’s also the election that lets us ask, finally, “Who cares what’s the matter with Kansas?” . . . . 

For a long time, right-wingers — and some pundits — have peddled the notion that the “real America”, all that really counted, was the land of non-urban white people, to which both parties must abase themselves. Meanwhile, the actual electorate was getting racially and ethnically diverse, and increasingly tolerant too. The 2008 Obama coalition wasn’t a fluke; it was the country we are becoming.

And sure enough that more diverse and, if you ask me, better nation just won big.

. . . .

A huge night for truth, justice, and the real American way.


Who cares what's the matter with Kansas? is my new slogan. I hope Kansas secedes for all the fuck I care about their fake real America.

I decided to take the high road and aim for a teaching moment in my reply:

You are probably a better person then I am. But I've been looking at mortality recently, as one more orbit clicks by on my personal journey around the sun, and while I get the celebration, and I'm glad for it, the fact that this was *even a question at all* shakes me to my very core. 

And I'm not really willing to engage with the hate mongers anymore. I just don't have the time. 

The Green Party friend, who got all Eeyore about how "don't you dare say Obama's a good guy because there's no difference between him and the republican guy"

I don't know how much tolerance I can muster for that either. I utterly despise a number of things that the Obama administration has done, but you have to be simply incapable of reason to say that there's no difference. 

You will never, ever, ever change a party for the good by leaving it. The Greens didn't learn that, and now the Dems are more right wing and the Greens have no say in the political landscape. Nicely done. The Tea Party stayed in the GOP and yanked them so far to the right. 

That's the lesson. You change from within. You primary the most right-wing Dems hard. You punish Dems for horrible votes. And then, they'll stop doing them. But if you leave the party, there is no reason for them to listen to you. And they will not listen to you. 

There's a reason Nate Silver never even really bothered to chart the Green and Libertarian candidates. It's because, in reality based math, they would never win, and would almost certainly gain 0 electoral votes.

Does the two party system suck? Yes, yes it does. But you will not change it by trying to create a new party. That part will fail. This is why we call it a two party system. There are two parties. You must change *a party*. That's what the right wingers did -- they changed the GOP. 

It's time to change the Democrats. And if you're going to run off and pretend to be smart and Green, well, what you're doing is making it harder for me to change Democrats and easier to elect Republicans. And you want me to have a ton of respect for that?

There was a moment yesterday when I was coming down the mountain and I looked to my right and the Blue Ridge stretching south was misty and seventeen shades of blue with green speckling down to the Valley floor, and I thought to myself, "Some days I really really love Virginia." I just knew that my fellow citizens wouldn't let me down. 

I grew up in Virginia in the so-called "real Virginia" part of the state, and came back after grad school to work in the state, first in Northern Virginia (the so-called not-really Virginia), and then I later moved back to where I grew up. People have questioned my choice to live here, citing the things Virginia still does wrong. How can I choose to live here, where my friends can't get married or adopt children, where my health care is a frill, where elected leaders are awfully intrusive of small government types, and so on? 

I live here because I love Virginia. I live here because I can make a difference. I live here because I believe that I and people like me can push the state forward. I have seen so much progress forward from when I was a child, and although we have a long way to go, I believe we will get there. 

I am also thrilled this election was decided at the ballot box and not in the courts.

The Republicans Bet Everything, and Obama Won It All
You remember the scene in Game Change, when John McCain’s adviser tells him that selecting Sarah Palin is “high risk, reward”? And McCain (or Ed Harris as McCain, or whatever) starts grinning uncontrollably? That is the approach the entire Republican Party has taken in almost every situation it has found itself since 2008. Republicans greeted Barack Obama’s presidency with a calculated wave of total opposition. They would not cut a deal on health care or on the federal budget, each time accepting the risk of total defeat rather than settling for half-measures, like giving Democrats some kind of token health care reform or small tax increase.

The gamble was that by denying Obama any support, they would render his presidency wholly partisan at best, and a dysfunctional failure at worst. They would increase their own chances of denying him a second term, and that their return to power would allow them to claim a full and absolute break with the past. They shoved all their chips onto tonight’s election. When the networks called it at 11:15 p.m., the totality of the right’s failure was clear. And because they bid up the stakes as high as they could, their loss was unusually devastating.

The gamble was not totally crazy, I have argued, because 2012 may have been the last chance to enact an undiluted conservative agenda. The electorate is driving steadily leftward, with the oldest voters representing the GOP’s strongest constituency, and the youngest voters its weakest. Every four years, a new 18–22-year-old cohort arrives that is more liberal than the one that has died off in the interim. The Republicans face a double peril with the youth vote. A far lower proportion of young voters are white, and those who are white are far less likely than their parents or grandparents to vote Republican. White voters over the age of 65 selected Romney by a twenty-point margin. White voters under 30 split evenly.

I'm from Eastern North Carolina, not Kansas*, but I am fond of referring to my parents as "Sarah Palin Approved Real Americans." I live in a big, diverse city now, but I'm still really fond of where I'm from, and I really hope that the Democrats don't actually give up on governing for those people even if they have to give up on them electorally. Those places aren't "the real America" and they don't count more than their population, but they do count. Don't pander to them, but there's nothing to be gained by saying "fuck you, I hate where you're from."

Erick Erickson gives a better concession speech than romney:
The Obama campaign ran a very good campaign. The Republicans did not. There was no fraud. There was no stealing the election. There was just a really good ground game from Barack Obama and a lot of smoke and mirrors from Team Romney and outside charlatans, many of whom will now go work for Republican Super PACs making six figure salaries, further draining the pockets of rich Republicans when not on television explaining how awesome and expert they are. Whether you can bring yourself to say it or not, like it or not, Barack Obama is, today, your President.

There will be a lot of blame to go around, but, if Republicans are honest, they’ll have to concede that the Romney campaign ran a bad campaign and only almost won because the President had a bad debate. Romney could not even win his home state, his second home state, or his vacation home state.
...
Over the past two years the GOP has atrophied into a party of intellectual lightweights in the House and Senate. They have run on “saving the free market”, but actively collaborated with the Democrats to drive-up the national debt to more than $16 trillion. Major conservative groups on the outside have, instead of reinforcing conservatism, continued their Bush era habit of reinforcing the party line.
...
Barack Obama won because his campaign team ran a tremendous ass kicking ground game while the Romney campaign clearly ran smoke and mirrors so convincingly inside the echo chamber of the GOP as to fool a lot of great Republican pundits and Dick Morris.
...
Compromise? Like hell. We’re going to keep fighting. And we will find someone who actually doesn’t speak conservatism like he learned it from Rosetta Stone last week. For those of you on the left licking your chops thinking this spells doom — the nation just spent $6 billion for the status quo. I’ll take my chances.

One of my friends posted this on Facebook a few minutes ago: 

Washington Examiner: Liberals on Twitter celebrate Obama victory with profane, racist tweets.

Seriously. The conservatives are already trying to take the 'less racist' moral high-ground (meaning that Jeb Bush is now more or less guaranteed the nomination in 2016). It was incredible to watch the GOP frantically try to rewrite the history of their campaign last night, once it became apparent that they were going to lose.

Lindsey Graham wins points for being completely correct in his assessment, but it's ironic that no prominent Republican said remotely as much during the campaign. Also, remember that Mitt Romney was by far the most electable candidate that they had to choose from.

This is an interesting when thinking about 2016 and beyond. Obama didn't win on a platform of hope, change, and a brighter future; he won on a platform of stay the course. There was no ambitious agenda, but rather a message of continuing slow progress. I don't have a personal problem with that (it's basically where I stand), but I think it makes the outlook for progressives look less rosy than the outlook for Democrats, which seems (based on demographics if nothing else) pretty good going forward.

I agree with fighting hard. Sharpen those elbows. But even though Obama fought hard, he was nice and continues to be nice. I have found fault with Obama for being nice, I have been angry with him almost beyond belief for his nicety when I longed for sharpened claws and drawn blood. I have worn my teeth to nubs with gnashing in my frustration that he continued to be so nice. 

To his great dignity, he has not taken my council on this matter. I don't always agree with him, but he continues to give me hope that nice guys can indeed win.

Aftermath observations: 

The Quebec non-Montreal branch of CBC Radio attempted an election round-up with what seemed like some Americans that the staff members knew or something, and the token Republican was dutifully hilarious, phoning in from North Carolina with a "theory" that the most charismatic candidates tend to win elections, that Romney had a better economic plan because he was super rich so duh, and that since 48% of the public voted for Romney, Obama's plans were obviously doomed to fail. 

Which sort of compounded my takeaway from... 

The BBC reporter in Boston last night, surrounded by Republicans that honestly believed that this was a dead lock for Romney. "They only watch Fox News and visit Republican Web sites and read Republican-slanted publications," she said, with a mounting tone of "I guess I knew this on paper, but holy shit." "They don't get any news that doesn't reflect their existing beliefs. They only see and hear messages controlled by the Republican Party," she said. And then the now-classic False Equivalence: "Mind you, I suppose there are Democrats who are like that too."

Mother Jones reports from a Republican election party in DC. The title tells you everything: "It Doesn't Get Any More Bleak Than This." But in case you need more, here's an excerpt:
The RNC's election party was expected to attract 2,500 to 3,000 guests, RNC spokesman Tom Kise told reporters early in the night. And the main space at the Ronald Reagan Building did indeed fill up fast as polls closed across the country. The party roared with the sound of rollicking country tunes and chatter among the crowd. The guests nibbled their snacks and sipped their cocktails and watched the returns, the men dressed in suits, the women in tight dresses.

As the news trickled in—big Democratic wins in Senate races in Massachusetts, Missouri, Indiana, and Connecticut—the energy ebbed. At just past 11 p.m., the night's emcee urged partiers to keep their spirits up, wait for all the results to come in, and to have "one or two more drinks" while they were at it.

But the party had thinned by the time Baier called the race for Obama. Half an hour later, it was abandoned but for a loyal few. A few couples still danced to the sound of the band while the catering crew cleared the food and the bartenders began stacking their cocktail glasses. Guests streamed toward the exits, arms interlocked, dressed in wool coats and scarves against the November chill.

It's a false dichotomy. In this cycle, Americans were never given the option to choose between a progressive and a moderate democrat.

That said, I'd argue that Obama has been as progressive as he could possibly be, given the legislature that he has to work with. I'll gladly take 4 more years of small progressive gains, given that it's pretty much the best that the Oval Office is legally allowed to do.

That's certainly true. My point was that you can't read much into this election in terms of whether or not America would pick a progressive Democrat. Americans will probably keep picking Democrats, as I said above, but there's nothing in Obama's election that indicates long term support for serious progressives. I say that because I get the sense that many of the Obama supports I know (here and in life) are coming from a much more progressive place politically than Obama. I think there's a good chance that what we've got ahead of us is years of demographically determined Democratic predominance, but of the center-left variety.

So it looks like the Democrat Berkley is gonna narrowly lose the Nevada Senate race 45.9-44.7. Some independent got 4.9% of the vote and I went to his website to see if he was a Green party candidate or some other party that might imply Berkley could've won if he didn't run. This is in one of the first paragraphs of his website:
Operation Fast and Furious. The CIA needs the drug money to have a black budget to wage illegal wars all over the world. They give weapons to the cartels in exchange for drugs which are then sold to the American public. They use the proceeds to fund those wars and they never have to report that budget to Congress. The cartels then use the weapons to terrorize the nations and perpetuate the myth that a "Drug War" is necessary. Those gun crimes are then used to attack our 2nd Amendment right to own guns. The feds then throw Americans in privately owned prisons where corporations receive government subsidies and the prisoners provide slave labor destroying American jobs. In addition, the amounts of drug money that these sales produce is too large to be done in cash. The money must be laundered through Wall Street banks. This means the Wall Street banks have full knowledge of where the money comes from. They are all complicit in this conspiracy.

At 4:30 am there were at least 100 people already on line to vote. And we didn't get the last voter through until about 9:30 pm. Didn't get home until midnight. No breaks. No pause. No stopping. Nonstop voters.

Some very interesting things: We are a largely black, fairly reliably Democratic precinct in the conservative area of Hampton Roads, Virginia. Voter turnout was AT LEAST 70% ( I was a little brain dead at the end, and the math wasn't coming easy). And all day - I mean from minute one to when we closed up shop - the Obama team had a lawyer-advocate at the poll from Washington, DC. Color me impressed - and very,very tired.

But if not during a recession, against an african american incumbent, when will the conservatives win?

That statement pretty much sums up why Republicans lost in 2008 and have failed to take back the Senate in both 2010 and 2012. 

Barack Obama and his campaign are not and have not been operating under the usual rules that have existed in political fights. He's something new and that was evident when he beat Hillary Clinton. That was lesson in just how good he is as a candidate and how great his supporting infrastructure is. Nobody learned from that. Let me repeat that, nobody learned from that, despite not even a single term Senator turning the upending game on its head over 4 years ago.

I think the Republicans, as a group, are finally starting to get a clue, after twice having their asses handed to them a "lying Kenyan commie socialist". It remains to be seen whether the party as a whole will truly learn from that. 

Rove isn't a magician or brilliant genius. He's an insular hack who can the Republicans what they want to believe, but can't understand reality. There's dozens like him the party and until all sides have political fistfight, not a discussion, but a real honest to go political fistfight, they Republicans will continue to dwindle.

Theta States: "Erick Erickson gives a better concession speech than romney:"

It's a good speech (and miles better than Romney's concession, which was just awful, especially compared to John McCain's, which was quite good). However, the premise is just flawed.

Erickson's not going to be able to find the "intellectual conservatives" that he's looking for until his party adjusts its platform and core values. Far too many of the party's basic economic tenents have been completely and thoroughly discredited. Any moderate Republican who disagrees on those points is quickly voted out of office. The party's hardline stance on social issues certainly isn't going to help them attract smart candidates either.

Also, I don't quite understand his criticism that the party's selection of Romney as the "most electable" candidate was a bad one. Perhaps Romney wasn't the perfect candidate, but does he really think that Newt would have done any better? What state would Newt have carried that Romney did not?

The Republicans would have had a better outcome if they nominated a moderate who had actual convictions. Nominating a more conservative candidate would have given Obama a landslide victory. Even Lindsey Graham agrees on this point.

I think my goal for the next four years is to worry less about offending assholes and worry more about actually seeing that conversations I'm involved in hew closer to reality and further away from Dispatches from the Limbaughverse. 

And start hammering away at that pervasive false-equivalency meme that has poisoned discourse in Canada as well as the U.S.A. The right and the left are not "the same." There are no left-wing equivalents to Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter, Glenn Beck, etc. etc. One side of the aisle has been taken over by frothing madmen, while the other shuffles and mumbles and looks at its feet and says "I guess Michael Moore does do some editing of his documentaries" instead of calling bullshit on Bullshit Mountain. 

I feel empowered and energized and ready to take on the steady corrosion of reality taking place across the media up here. If we all do the same, instead of worrying about whether or not some brainwashed dipsticks will get mad when confronted with daylight, I think there are great strides to be made in the public discourse of both countries.

The Republican brand is poison except with whites over 30.

This is demonstrably not true.

Anecdata: I went to school in North Carolina and came out to Los Angeles with a shit-load of like-minded friends, all liberals, progressives, and even one committed socialist. The people I hang out and fraternize with in "the industry" are all over thirty and proudly progressive.

This year I had a chance to meet and get close to some of the new crop of college-age interns from my alma mater. They share the same principles, just as closely as my friends and I did—and they're much more conservative. Like the part-time art-school rapper who tweeted "Clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose" in support of Romney. Or the bright-eyed, fresh-faced Christian woman who didn't support gay marriage even though she's in a long-term relationship with another woman.

The Republican brand is not poison—only certain parts of it. Coalitions have and will continue to change with society. It's not so long ago that the Democratic party was all-in for segregation. These young opinion leaders are not dittoheads or mouth-breathers; they are problem-solvers in their own right, and some of them will sculpt a New Right coalition. It won't be as big a tent, but the kids underneath will be committed in all the ways that Obama's 2008 coalition also was.

Democrats continue to rely on the young without substantially courting them at their peril.

This is going to happen. The GOP has kept their party in lockstep with threats of running out moderates or conservatives who work with the other side of the aisle in the primaries, and were as good as their word.

The problem is, the radical right wingers they nominated kept losing. So now, there will be a contingent of congressional Republicans who know they can get more working with rather than against the Democrats, and that their party won't dare try to punish them for it in the primaries in two years.

I think my goal for the next four years is to worry less about offending assholes and worry more about actually seeing that conversations I'm involved in hew closer to reality and further away from Dispatches from the Limbaughverse. 

I clicked through to the FB walls of a few people that I put on "Most Important Updates Only" status for the election. I quickly decided that they are staying there. Forever. If their kids do something cool or somebody dies, the number of likes or comments will cause that update to make it to my news feed.

Although, I am disappointed in how the election went in Pima county. McSally v. Barber too close to call? We just got him in this summer! No extra money for schools? Aren't we something like 48th in education? My sister teaches at an downtown Phoenix Title I school, her classroom has 4 donated computers, two of which don't work.

It's also worth noting the 'achilles heel of capitalism' in America. The desire to produce goods at the lowest cost possible caused the importation of slavery, which eventually begat a huge voting block that has a long memory. Importing low wage, off the books Mexicans is falling into a similar cycle*. You can not screw people over and then ask for their vote. Or rather you can, but watch them give you the legislative finger repeatedly and enjoy doing so. 

* This bodes extremely well for the Robots/Evolved Cats platform of 2072

It's my living room, and I don't want to be hectored in it. However, I do have a few friends and relations who see things differently and whose relationships I wouldn't want to compromise - for them, I either ignore or unsubscribe for a while. I do believe in diversity of views and conversation in civil society, but the assholish version of that doesn't have to happen on my page, where I want to interact with people of goodwill.

My 14 month old daughter woke up just after Ohio was called for Obama. She looked a little bleary eyed, but like she had woken from a nap, not in the middle of her night's sleep.

I said, "Obama won!"

She stared at me bleary eyed again.

"The supreme court is safe, Rosie!" 

She smiled hugely and gave me the biggest hug as she made one of her happy sounds.

My son had fallen asleep at his usual time and was still asleep, and I couldn't help but think how relieved I was there will be less talk of school vouchers (aka: GOP plan to dismantle public school systems) at the federal level and that my son will continue to receive the services he needs through a public school system interested in his growth and development.

Because I can't really talk politics at work and I try to not talk politics on Facebook so I don't totally alientate all my conservative friends and family members so I have to HOLD IT ALL INSIDE

I come from a conservative family, so I think I have some idea of how you feel, but I think the best approach is to try to engage... a little. I'll hear someone spout a lot of nonsense, and rather than give a derisive snort of impatience or fury and start going on about how I think they're wrong because of reasons a) through z) and subparagraphs thereof, I pick one aspect of what they said, present a little factual evidence that I am sure of, and then ask them a question. If they answer that question I might comment mildly on their answer by offering some more facts that contradict it and ask another. When I've asked a question they can't answer, I leave it at that. It feels like I've accomplished something, even if it's only a tiny step in the right direction, and I usually don't hear that specific argument from the same person again. 

It's better to engage and to show respect for people as individuals and to share what you know with them than to write all conservatives and reactionaries as some sort of monolithic behemoth — which, let me tell you, is never the case. Very few people are completely incapable of listening to reason — it's all in how new information and new opinions are presented to them. Moreover, this is how I want to be treated when people disagree with me.

Because I couldn't summarize lessons learned from this election any better, here are the key points as written/posted by The Votemaster over at www.electoral-vote.com: 

"Here are some of our takeways, in no particular order.

- It's not just the economy, stupid. It's the whole package
- Abandoning large constitutencies, like women, Latinos, and young voters is not a winning formula
- The partisan identification in 2008 was not a freak accident. There are more Democrats than Republicans
- The candidate matters: on paper Rick Perry and Mitt Romney were great, but the real men weren't
- Nominating a sneering plutocrat who likes firing people and writes off half the country is not a wise move
- If you can't release your tax returns because they are full of poison, don't run for President
- There aren't enough billionaires to buy the election
- Don't talk about gay marriage unless you are supporting it
- And above all, don't talk about rape except maybe if you are proposing to castrate rapists"

A good 1/3 or my facebook feed is folks declaring the apocalypse is nigh, and that Obama will screw over Israel. A friend of mine posted several paragraphs last night about sitting in her kids' room after the results were in, watching them sleep as she literally wept for their future. 

This is what the poisonous, fearmongering, Father Coughlin-style rhetoric that has spewed from the likes of Limbaugh, Rove, Coulter, Beck, Hannity, Farah, Prager and countless others over the last two decades or more has wrought. They've successfully convinced so many conservatives that anyone who disagrees with them on a given political issue is just plain evil. Polarizing this country to such an extent that otherwise reasonable, rational people have wholeheartedly bought into the melodrama and seem incapable of seeing their opponents as fellow human beings. 

I wonder where this road will lead.

Meh, you can say what you like on MY fb page, everyone else does. :D

Part of me is disappointed this morning, but honestly, Romney is not the Republican I would have wanted to see in the WH if it were up to me. This nation IS changing, and that fact wouldn't have changed just because we'd put a different person into the White House. The kind of change I want to see in this nation does not happen at the ballot box or in a legislature or in an Oval Office anyway. So, I'll live.

Meanwhile, I don't envy Obama the task ahead of him. I have a regularly scheduled prayer meeting to go to tonight, one in which we pray for this nation, and I can assure you he will be thoroughly prayed for. He's gonna need it.

- The candidate matters: on paper Rick Perry and Mitt Romney were great, but the real men weren't

This. The Republicans failed to learn the lesson of 2004: It doesn't matter if people don't like the incumbent much when your candidate is basically a big sign with "I'm not the other guy" written on it in crayon and stuffed into a suit. If the GOP runs somebody who stands for something, that probably flips enough voters to win the election and validates the whole "obstruct ALL THE THINGS" strategy they've been running with for the past two years. But their field of candidates was full of insincere jackasses who clearly wanted to be in charge way more than they wanted to accomplish anything (Romney, Perry, Cain) and completely sincere lunatics who were so out there even the Republicans couldn't buy into them (Santorum, Paul). 

Bachmann was somewhere at the intersection of those two streets.

I'm actually happy 37 didn't pass. Even if Monsanto "succeeded", the problem with 37 was that it was far too selective. GMO labeling is fine, but why no labels for milk, cheese and meat products that EAT GMO foods?

There was an equally sordid corporate interest vibe behind 37, so it's good it didn't pass. Now a real proposition on accurate labeling that includes all GMO-related foods, including products that come from sources that consume GMO foods, can be drafted and we can see Monsanto and the meat and dairy conglomerates join forces to defeat it.

NPR:
For [the] record, here are the latest numbers from Florida, Ohio and Virginia, three states that gave pollsters headaches yesterday.

We'll start with Florida:

With nearly all precincts reporting, Obama is winning the state with 0.50 percent lead. The threshold to trigger an automatic recount? 0.50 percent. This result may change and break further in Obama's favor because, as The Miami Herald reports, some of the outstanding votes are in Miami-Dade county, which Obama won by a 25 point margin. Full results from the county, the Herald explains, may not be known until later today.

By the way, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson received almost 43,000 votes in the state. The difference between Obama and Romney was 46,000.

I'd disagree there, Brandon. With a competent campaign, "ran a business that specialized in turning around big deficits" could have been a huge plus for Romney. And being the popular governor of a conservative state doesn't guarantee you a trip to the White House, but it sure as hell doesn't tank a campaign - it describes four of our last six presidents. Perry just turned out to be a total dipshit, and Romney...well, when the entire substance of your plan to get the economy on track is "I will champion small business," with no more detail than that, you are bad at elections.

Far too many of the party's basic economic tenents have been completely and thoroughly discredited.

They were bullshit all along, and everyone knew, but it at least gave the GOP some room to maneuver, twist the public conversation their way. They've really worn it down to the nub now though. They've got nothing else to say. They've dragged the Overton window up to the edge of a steep drop, and because they ceded all that central ground to the Democrats they can't easily march it back. Additionally their value as an opposition party has dropped to nothing, and that's not good for the government.

I'm babbling tired and dumb, but I still kind of think they would do best to head a little back to the center and reinvent compassionate conservatism, which will please the entitlement-haters who sense its true meaning, and woo the non-white voters with religious appeals. Best done after Democrats have paid the price for cleaning up the economy, so the GOP can act like geniuses again while they cook up their big scams.

I think Nate Silver underestimated turnout for Obama slightly, and perhaps overestimated turnout for Romney slightly. Almost all the senate pickups (come on Heidi!) are within either positive or negative coat-tail margins. Only Missouri shows serious ticket-splitting action that I can see. So I think Nate's presidential race cautiousness had multiplier effects on his final calls of nearly tied senate races. Fine with me, gives us some happy surprises to go with the predicted victories. Something a little sweeter about winning a less certain contest.

Not when the candidate has made themselves super rich by laying off or firing people, especially in down economy. If Romney had worked himself up from the mailroom of failing company and then turned it around as CEO, that would have been a killer story. Him repeating "I'm a businessman, I' a businessman" in this economy? Not so much.

To add to the cavalcade of good news this morning... Democratic friends of mine from California are very excited about Mark Takano, a newly elected congressman. Here's a report on him from The Washington Blade. Excerpt:
Chuck Wolfe, CEO of the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, said a Takano victory would be significant because in addition to becoming the first openly gay person of color to be elected to Congress as a Japanese-American, Takano would also be the first out person to represent California as a federal lawmaker.

“We’re excited that Mark Takano is heading to Capitol Hill, where he will be the first openly LGBT person of color to serve in Congress, and the first out Californian,” Wolfe said. “Mark joins a small but growing caucus of openly LGBT lawmakers in Washington who are challenging their colleagues to stand on the right side of history.”

A public school teacher for 23 years specializing in British literature, Takano is no stranger to public service. In 1990, he was elected to the Riverside Community College District’s Board of Trustees and has served on that body since then. In 2001, Takano helped shepherd through the board a measure enabling Riverside Community College employees to have domestic partner benefits.

Shmod, they're sore losers, but I'm not sure what your point is? (Not trying to be snarky, I just want to know what posting the right-leaning newspaper's front page proves about my state.) The Arizona Republic doesn't speak for the 43% of AZ voters for Obama. I wish there were more Obama supporters here, but I feel more connected to Democrats here than I did living in liberal Seattle. It's nice to have something to fight for.

Also, Kyrsten Sinema is a straight up bad-ass, gay rights supporting lady who has a narrow lead right now for one of the House races in the state. That's pretty awesome, regardless of the outcome.

I just got up after a late night working the polls, made even later by counting stupid write-in votes. Would you people please stop writing in stupid invalid write ins? We write them all down, every single god damned name written on a ballot. It takes pages and pages of paper to write them all. Records are kept in case it actually matters, but it never matters. Unless the number of write-ins exceed the number of votes for the leading candidate, the tallied votes are just lumped together and ignored. The votes are all announced under the category "WI" so your vote for Ron Fucking Paul carried exactly the same weight as the idiots who vote for Mickey Mouse: none.

Unless the DEA wants to start doing street level busts and prosecuting those people in federal court, it does. Look at the states that have legal medicinal marijuana, despite federal law, there are plenty of dispensaries in Colorado, because the feds have better things to do with their time.

Keeping weed illegal federally and legal locally will definitely make it de facto legal, after all medicinal marijuana is illegal federally.

Here's where things get interesting. By having it illegal federally, the risk of creating a large business centered around weed exists. There's some small risk in being a small distributor or grower, but the capital risk from being a massive factory farm is too high. The end result for now would be an environment where weed growing looks more like wine with small estates, rather than massive breweries.

Who Is Most Pissed Off After This Election by Robert J. Elisberg

"Mitch McConnell must be so pissed off, too. After doing one of the most irresponsible things any Senate party leader has ever done by declaring that his Number One priority was not working to help America but rather to make sure that Barack Obama wasn't re-elected, he spent four years shirking his sworn duties and working instead to defeat the president. And after all of that effort, he wasn't able to do it. Despite his great efforts of his Number One priority, President Barack Obama was re-elected. Mitch McConnell must be so pissed off."

"Imagine how pissed off Karl Rove, the Koch Brothers and Sheldon Adelson must be, having spent all that money to defeat Barack Obama -- hundreds of millions of dollars -- and having absolutely nothing to show for it. I spent ten bucks yesterday for lunch, and at least I got a sandwich and bowl of soup."

Sure, you'd likely regret smoking two ounces in one sitting but in the big picture an ounce or two of pot has never really been all that much in the (bloodshot) eyes of the law.
posted by item

Actually, in New York City, an ounce is the threshold level that raises a street possession bust (not public consumption, sale or display, but simple possession) from basically running a red light level to a felony. So in New York, the clever stoner makes sure not to carry more than 7/8th on her/his person. 

I think New York legalizes weed within 5 years, however. The dam has burst now. I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime, but I now really believe we will see national legalization within a decade or so.

IMO not; growing your own is also legal. When that's so, there's a thriving business in seeds and hydroponics and lots and lots of growers as there's little legal risk. There's also the probability that a co-op of growers will start moving stuff out of the state - completely legal under a set amount means that one can have a dispersed growop.

Brandon Blatcher: "Texas could be a swing state by 2020."

It would likely take a Latino candidate. Texas' Latino population has increased to nearly 1/3 in the last couple of decades, and Latinos do traditionally vote Democrat. But even though there's a large population of eligible Latino voters, a significant percentage of them don't register to vote. Presumably, they're just not that enthused about candidates.

Even though Texas is a minority-majority state, the African American population in Texas has been dropping. African Americans and Latinos tend to be poorer and less well-educated than whites, and in general there are fewer opportunities available to poorer Texans than to the rich. The state's class divide is quite strong. 

Worth noting as well that Plano, Lubbock and Abilene make up three of the top five most conservative cities in America. (The others are Provo, UT and Hialeah, FL.) Their senior citizen population will probably reach close to 20% by 2020. 

I'd love to see Texas come into play. But it will take some doing.

Even if they just have to spend money in Texas to defend it they're sunk. The place is huge. But the demographic trends suggest the state could actually flip in the next few elections if Democrats continue to win Hispanics by these margins. 

Remember, not only are the kids of immigrants citizens, but the kids of undocumented immigrants are citizens, and have grown up in an atmosphere of ugly, racist moral panic directed at them and their families. These people are and will continue to be fierce, lifetime Democratic voters, especially as Democrats become more and more friendly to them on immigration issues in coming years.

From this post
After a string of defeats, the Democrats rebooted in 1992, nominating a Southern moderate and jettisoning the more unpopular parts of their agenda, at least at the national level. At some point, the GOP will do the same. 

I guess I am not seeing what part of the GOP agenda (say, from the party platforms) is not unpopular and getting more so.

Also from dougzilla's article:

"In fact, the whole Republican Senate must be so pissed off. When President Obama nominated Elizabeth Warren to be head of the Consumer Protection Agency, an important but reasonably piddly bureau, GOP senators fought her with the fervor of missionary crusaders and wouldn't approve her for the job. And so, what Elizabeth Warren did next was announce her candidacy for the Senate in Massachusetts. If the Republican senators had simply approved Elizabeth Warren to head a simple bureaucratic job, she never would have run for the Senate, and Republican Scott Brown would have been re-elected. Republican senators must be so pissed off. Your heart really goes out to them. In a manner of speaking."

There's an awful lot of "white males" here in America, and too many of them vote like idiots (along with too many "white females"). But there are plenty of us who see the problems we have, and are incredibly happy to work with people of all "races", sexes, genders, (and religions) who want to get rid of gender and racial bullshit that limit too many Americans.

The problem is that the GOP push for extremists was specifically designed to intimidate moderate Republicans into NOT compromising, because otherwise they'd be targeted for a primary challenge by a very well funded Tea Party activist.

On her way out, she said, President Bush noticed her “obama” button. “He jumped back, almost literally,” she said. “And I knew what he was thinking. So I reassured him it was Obama, with a ‘b.’ And I explained who he was. The President said, ‘Well, I don’t know him.’ So I just said, ‘You will.’”

I hate how republicans are talking about Obama winning mainly because of his "aggressive campaign". Do people at Fox News think we are that dumb? Ads don't convince people, reality does. And besides, Romney's ads weren't exactly gentle and caring.

Sorry to say, if this election were primarily reality-based, we wouldn't be looking at a GOP House.

The problem is, the radical right wingers they nominated kept losing. So now, there will be a contingent of congressional Republicans who know they can get more working with rather than against the Democrats, and that their party won't dare try to punish them for it in the primaries in two years.

The problem is, the Tea Party is brilliantly successful at grassroots politics of the living-room, community-hall and get your local nutjob nominated. So it's not certain that the congressional Republicans will fall in line behind the moderate factions of the party. The Tea Party is a loose cannon. The mainstream Republican party doesn't have the capacity to "punish" or not punish in the primaries. 

Fanaticism gets people out to those nominating meetings a year ahead of the election. It's harder and less likely to get highly motivated about moderation. Moderation does not get people marching in the streets. And the Tea Party differs from most fringe groups in that it has sugar daddies with very very deep pockets. 

For this reason I foresee at least another election cycle of Republican division, becoming ever-more chaotic. Look for the Tea Party to run a third-party candidate in 2016.

If the sugar daddies cut off their allowance, then that might change.

I'll see your Julian Castro, and I'll raise you one Ted Cruz. There are small pockets of Democrat friendly Texans, but the state on the whole is as conservative as can be and demographics aren't going to change that any time soon.

I live in Texas and I have to disagree with you. 

Paul Sadler managed to pick up 40.6% (3.1 mil) of the vote against Ted Cruz, who won with 56.6% (4.5 mil) on a campaign that had virtually no funds. He was an underdog from the start, but I think he made more than a fair showing against Cruz, who was blessed with all the Tea Party money he could spend. 

Also, while we all knew Texas would go to Romney, the President picked up 41.4% of the Texas vote - ~3.3 million voted for Obama, which is only slightly less than the 2008 results, where the President garnered ~3.5 million votes. It was a wide margin for Romney, but not a shut-out by any means. 

Texas as a state is not as overwhelmingly red as people would like to believe when compared to some other red states like Wyoming or Idaho - we just have more people. Everything is a cycle and I believe we'll see Texas come back around again.

Both she and Jay Nixon, our governor, basically have to out-Republican the Republicans just to convince that one needed sliver of rural out-state voters that they are not evil incarnate.

I am a little baffled at the news that Romney only wrote a victory speech. Is this true? Was he that confident? I know that national polls showed it to be pretty close but there was a not-insignificant number of poll watchers (Nate, Sam etc) as well as every single bookmaker who not only never had Romney as favorite to win, but often had Obama at a pretty healthy lead. I mean, did the campaign just ignore all this information? Talk about being in an echo chamber.You'd think they'd want to be able to consider all of the information out there to better craft the campaign, rather than just the stuff they wanted to see.

Also, I'm one who is very much in favor of driving the democratic party in a more progressive direction. And certainly in places where we can, we need to work towards getting the most progressive candidates possible elected. Those are the people who can drive the party, and the country, in the direction it needs to go.

But we also need candidates, like McCaskill, who can ACTUALLY WIN ELECTIONS in places like Missouri, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, and North Dakota.

That means candidates who can pull a decent amount of votes from rural areas, small towns, suburbs, conservative religious folks, and all the rest of the "Republican core." They don't need to win a majority there, but they need to win enough. That is exactly what McCaskill does.

The type of party than can embrace BOTH the McCaskills and the Warrens is the type of party that will win in the long run in America.

Salon's Mary Elizabeth Williams has some pithy things to say about how Romney's concession speech fell short of graciousness. By comparison, even John McCain managed to make a graceful and moving speech (and, I read, to tell Sarah Palin, who was determined to make a speech, that she was NOT GOING TO SPEAK), but not Romney.

I honestly expected more defiance from the right. NRO is reading like a wake today.

When the old white guy that is Karl Rove demands that the young white female news anchor of Fox News recind the calling of Ohio for Obama and she walks down the hall to talk directly to the data wranglers, who were all older white guys, and they say "Yes, we're right, it's over" there's not a lot to defy.

I've watched Dallas and Houston shift mostly back even as the suburbs have gone more Tea Party.

You've got to look at the county-level state map to see the trend. Harris (Houston proper), Dallas, Travis (Austin) & Bexar (San Antonio) all leaning blue, and the Rio Grande valley region, which is more largely hispanic. I do think there's hope -- we need to grow some good city & county-level candidates that can move up to state-wide seats when the time comes. Castro has a fantastic start at this.

Holy Zarquon's Singing Fish: "Didn't happen under Bush, even at his most ascendant. Obama stepped up dispensary raids dramatically, in fact. So you'd need some evidence for that beyond "he's Republican, and a shithead.""

The increase in the number of dispensaries between 2008 and 2009 was dramatic and many of the new ones were in it for a cash grab and decided to do things like not get a business licence, not pay their taxes or sell large quantities of pot out the back door. Talking to dispensary operators after the last round of busts here in Seattle they didn't seem worried. Want to stay in business and not get busted by the Feds, follow the local laws.

How Ridiculous Gerrymanders Saved the House Republican Majority 

Yes, I noticed we haven't really been talking about the situation in the House yet.

Right now CNN has the House at 233 R, 193 D, with 9 still undecided. Assuming those 9 break 50/50 we're looking at 237.5 R and 194.5 D.

The current U.S. House started out as 242 R / 193 D in 2011 but is currently 240 R / 190 D. 

So this election represents a really miniscule gain for Democrats. And the split in the House (55%R/45%D) is quite a long ways off from the split in the electorate (48%R/50%D).*

Democrats and going to have to figure out a strategy to address this problem if they really want to move the country forward.

*This is assuming the presidential vote truly represents the country's R/D split. It would be very interesting to calculate the R/D split of the votes in the U.S. House races to see how it breaks out. My guess is, if anything it will tilt a bit more D than the presidential race.

Not a proud moment to be a white male.

Hi, so, like, I'm a white male. Totally didn't plan to be or anything, I just kinda came out that way. For a long time I didn't understand that being white and male was different from being not-white or not-male, but over the last few years I've learned that apparently there's a lot of bullshit involving gender/racial bigotry and discrimination, and it sucks, and I'd really like America to work at not doing that quite so much.

I'm not so proud that the situation's so shitty, and I'm a little ashamed that it took me until college to start realizing that, hey, the world outside my rich white asshole suburb hometown is a lot different and more complicated than the world I grew up knowing. But I'm proud as hell that, despite all the sheltered Americans who don't know any better, the country as a whole is moving a little bit towards being as okay as I thought it was when I was a young privileged idiot.

Maybe you mean "OLD white male" and maybe there's a club of white males who totally think their whiteness and maleness ought to be a badge of honor or whatever. But I grew up with Sesame Street and Barney and Pokemon, wherein people different than me are interesting and awesome and I want to treat them with respect and be their friends and stuff. Mitt Romney doesn't like Sesame Street, so, I'm okay that he lost even though he's white? I don't know, I'm confused, maybe you can help tell me why I'm actually ashamed and suchlike

I think using Republican/Democrat split in the context of House elections isn't quite right because the candidate are more individualized. The Presidential candidate becomes the de facto avatar of their respective party, but there's more room for House candidates to occupy parts of the middle or just plain weird spaces on the left-right continuum. A vote for one of those people isn't exactly a vote for R or D generally.

It can be a reference to Montana, but I'm not sure that's what he meant, since Montana's electoral results were mostly mixed (e.g. went for Romney but their Democratic Senator was reelected, probably elected a Democratic governor but elected a Republican to the House). Also, apart from probably hunting there, I don't know that Nugent has any particular connection to the state.

So it looks like (per CNN) we'll have 55 caucusing with the Democrats (assuming the two 3rd party/Independent Senators do) and 45 Republicans.

The compares with a 53/47 split in the current Senate, so a pickup of 2 for the Ds. (source)

FYI at the peak of the 111th Congress, Obama's first two years, it was 59/41. (Well, it was 59/40 and 59/39 for a couple of really brief periods.) (source)

So Obama's first election brought a nearly filibuster-proof D majority to the Senate, the Tea Party 'revolution' walked that back to just a bare majority, and this election takes it back to halfway between the two.

Unfortunately, if both sides continue sliding to the right, they will both fall off into that abyss. The same would be true if there were a true ultra-leftist party and a liberal party pretending to be center-right. A two-party system only works if *both* sides compromise. The last four years have seen compromise after compromise on one side, with cries of impending Armageddon on the other side.

Yes, both sides would have cried about the End of Days if the opposing candidate had won. The difference is that the right-wing tail wagging the Republican dog is convinced that End of Days is literally what's going to happen now.

The heroic image of Huey Long protecting the poor from disastrous legislation by reading a combination of Shakespeare and oyster recipes for days on end is pretty much the exact opposite of how the filibuster is used today.

philip-random: The difficulty is, our side is right and their side is ignorant. We look down at them cos they're ignorant and they look down at us cos they're ignorant.

That sounds snarky. It's not. I'll concede that there's wisdom and good sense hidden in the traditions and faiths of the American right wing, but it comes bundled with a whole lot of really weird worldviews and ideas about people that aren't exactly like you in every way. "Every man for himself" is a stupid philosophy that requires a lot of entitlement to believe, but because it's so selfish and entitled it's hard to dispel.

You could say there's a similar selfishness on the left – but it's a lot harder, I think, to reach out to somebody trying to reject you than it is to show empathy for somebody who needs it. Both are very hard, but showing empathy for somebody who's actively trying to piss you off takes a very special patience.

It's well and good to say "rah bipartisanship everybody reach over!", which is why Obama said that, and then the other side decided they'd rather do nothing than work with the enemy. They ran a candidate this year whose strategy was "pretend Obama is the root of all evil", and they lost, but not by a huge amount. Meaning a lot of people think that's an okay strategy.

Working with people who aren't like us is important. We still have to do it. But we have to recognize that some people actively oppose cooperation, and that unless we call those people out for what they're doing, expose the toxicity of their worldview, we'll lose not only them but the ones that listen to them.

Democrats are slowly growing a spine. They need more of one. When you're the adult in the room, it's your job to tell the kids who are assholes to sit in a corner so that everybody else can play together. You don't get to just say "Well every kid should get to be happy", when some kids' fun only comes at the expense of others. And that's what some of these Republicans are: overgrown children who've spent their lives justifying their ignorant, selfish, bullying ways.

Don't believe me? Look at Romney. Heck, look at Ryan, who still looks and sounds like a kid, down to the oversized suits, backwards cap, and high school econ/debate tactics.

Angus King has steadfastly refused to say which party he'll caucus with

Yes, when you're the swing vote you're stupid to just give up your negotiating position before getting something for it. The swing vote is (or should be, if played right) one of the the most powerful seats in the entire chamber.

But it is probably going to make a lot more sense to caucus with the majority party because they're actually going to be able to deliver something to him. If the majority party flips, that calculation may change . . . 

King isn't literally the swing vote needed to create a majority, which would be an even more powerful position, but since the Senate needs 60 on many occasions and he's part of the group needed to get them from 53 to 60, it's still the same type of position. He'll have a lot more power to keep the Ds from reaching 60 than the Rs--who generally won't be able to reach 60 no matter what--which is another factor making him more likely to caucus with the Ds. With the Ds he'll be the person in a position to block their progress on pretty much every vote if they don't keep him happy, whereas with the Rs he'll just be one more member of their minority. 

Also, the Ds will have the plumb committee chairmanships, other committee assignments, and general perks to hand out. If you live in Maine and don't see King grabbing some of those chairmanships, committee assignments, and perks as he negotiates caucusing with the Dems, vote him out next time around because he's an incompetent buffoon.

Fact is, the abyss exists and it won't be negated unless both sides do some serious giving ...

I'm reminded of the time before the American Civil War. The South felt put upon and seceded because an anti-slavery Northerner was elected. Fact is, the South virtually had their way from the beginning of the republic and could not tolerate the North ever making decisions over them. This concept of theirs has mutated into a notion of "states rights," but, in reality the South was always ready and happy to trample over the North's states rights when it suited them. Let me use as an extended example the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. From Wikipedia:

[the law] made any Federal marshal or other official who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave liable to a fine of $1,000. Law-enforcement officials everywhere now had a duty to arrest anyone suspected of being a runaway slave on no more evidence than a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify on his or her own behalf. In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. ... Since any suspected slave was not eligible for a trial this led to many free blacks being conscripted into slavery...

Up to 1850, the first 12 presidents, nine were from the South. The three northerners were each one term. The senate favored slave holding states. The Supreme Court for this reason was dominated by southern interests. 

That began to change and the South could not tolerate it. After 1850, the next presidents were from New York, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Illinois). 

I think this is similar to today. The old white heterosexual orthodoxy does not want to allow any sharing of power, does not admit/realize that it contributed to the mess we are in and is not willing to change. They don't even recognize it has been their ideas that have run government for decades now. 

I don't see how compromise should be made with someone who (almost) always has their way. It should be full steam forward on pent-up social change.

That another four years of economic stagnation and escalating debt will cure them of their insane appetite for charismatic liberals? If four years of endless failure have not rid them of this madness, the disease may well be terminal. 

There are whackadoos out there who still are attempting to claim that Romney was the better candidate for the economy, despite having (a) no plan and (b) a history built on outsourcing and ruin. 

The response to that is simple – if you claim any sort of concern for "the economy", and you're not taking to the rooftops to scream for socialized medicine, better regulation of the financial sector and a smaller military, you're part of the problem. 

If you can't see that a healthy, educated, motivated population that feels that they are valued regardless of race, orientation or religion is good for the economy, you're part of the problem. 

If you don't understand that money doesn't mean much without air you can breathe, you're part of the problem. 

We've allowed the "economy" argument to shrink and shrink and shrink until it literally means how much profit the 1% are making off the 99%. "The economy" is big. It takes a lot of vision and a lot of thought to see how everything from public health to national parks are part of a healthy economy. That's just part of the framing that needs to be broken so it can be taken back.

I think the big winner here among the aggregators might be Votamatic, which gave extremely stable predictions and had the EV count (and maybe the states) called almost exactly since mid-July. On the other hand, this is just one election.

Sam Wang and Nate Silver agreed on pretty much everything related to the presidential race, but they did disagree on the Senate. Nate Silver was predicting 52-53 seats caucusing with the Democrats; Sam Wang predicted 54-56 such seats. It'll be 55 seats if Angus King joins the Democrats; 54 seats otherwise. These were election night predictions, though, so I'm not surprised that Sam Wang's polls-only model beat Nate Silver's polls-plus-other-factors model.

I would be extremely impressed by a model that accurately predicted competitive House races.

On the biggest political story of the year, the conservative media just got its ass handed to it by the mainstream media. And movement conservatives, who believe the MSM is more biased and less rigorous than their alternatives, have no way to explain how their trusted outlets got it wrong, while the New York Times got it right. Hint: The Times hired the most rigorous forecaster it could find.
If you refuse correct information, your decision making process, no matter how rigorous, will fail badly. If you insist that 1+1=3, it doesn't matter how careful, how thorough your work is, you will be wrong.

Need to also include the debate threads... I can't fathom how much of all of that I've read.


Mentioned this elsewhere, but yesterday i registered about 420 new voters at the polls here in MN. That was about 20% of our voting precinct. 

Word is same day registration was huge this year, and I'm thinking that made the difference in the Amendments failing.

I just discovered that this past year there was a group of people who tried to get same day registration declared illegal. Somehow, I don't know how, I missed that. They where shot down in August. In hindsight I have to wonder if what happened yesterday was what they feared would happen. massive same day registration resulting in a loss for their regressive Amendments. 

The tactic failed and the MN GOP got punished for it as well.

flug: " So this election represents a really miniscule gain for Democrats. And the split in the House (55%R/45%D) is quite a long ways off from the split in the electorate (48%R/50%D).*

Democrats and going to have to figure out a strategy to address this problem if they really want to move the country forward."

Just looking at the numbers is a mistake, and I think even the numbers tell a different story if you look beneath the raw splits.

The first thing to note is that incumbents in congress historically win 85-90% of contested elections. So, though you can have big swings in wave elections, these are rare, and this was simply not going to be a wave election the way the economy has been.

Most of the churn is going to be in seats held by freshmen (back-benchers who aren't in high-profile committee positions yet) and the GOP freshmen lost something like 9/87 seats. Democratic freshmen? Two losses (one of whom was in my district, which as my Weigel link shows, was redistricted into an easy GOP pickup.)

It's also important to look at who got elected last night. Look at the comments above. First lesbian Senator. First Hindu-American. First Asian woman. First disabled congresswoman. Latinos, African-Americans, and ladies, ladies, ladies! This is not only good for policy going forward, it's good to motivate sectors of the electorate that will suddenly see themselves in the people who represent them.

So, I'm more sanguine about the house. John Boehner and Eric Cantor and even Paul Ryan are going to have to look not only at the changing electorate, but the changing demographics of their own colleagues, and decide if they can continue to try to win with just white dudes making policy for just white dudes. I am not predicting the rise of the GOP moderate in the house in the next two years, but I do think the power dynamics have changed even though the raw partisan split hasn't.

More on why the House actually looks pretty good for the blue team:
First, there is the House. Not long ago, Democrats had to abide by the concerns of their more moderate southern and "blue-dog" brethren. Well, this is going to be less of an issue going forward because there aren't many of those centrists left. Many were wiped out in 2010, and while Congressman John Barrow inexplicably won his contested congressional seat in Georgia, the Democratic party, by and large, no longer has a southern wing. Actually, let me correct that: Democrats no longer have a southern white wing.

By one measure, the Democrats are now down to about a dozen blue-dog moderates. That creates a caucus in the House of Representatives that is more decisively liberal and non-southern than perhaps at any point in history.

Lauding Nate Silver above other poll aggregators for doing this -- even though they basically all had Florida at 50/50 -- seems to me to be missing the point.

Also one of the big differences between Nate Silver's model and a lot of the others is that he actually gives much lower confidence values to how likely his predictions are to be correct. So ironically Silver would actually be more vindicated if a prediction he had at 60% and another model had at 95% ended up going the other way and making them both wrong, because that would make it much more likely that his confidence level was more accurate.

Nate Silver did well. Sure, he got all 50 right, but he predicted vote proportions for Obama and Romney in every state, and for forecasters like me, the better measure is how closely he did on the specific margins rather than right or wrong. You could forecast DC as 51% Obama and be "right" on the electoral college, but that's a terrible prediction (it was actually 91.4%).

So here's how well Nate Silver did:
- Got the winner in all 50 states and DC
- Got both Obama and Romney vote shares within margin of error for 98 of 102 predictions (Hawaii and West Virginia) -- typical margins of error assume 19 times out of 20, or just over 95 of 102.
- 1.5% error on average across all states (many of which had little polling) -- his suggested margin of error was 3.7%
- 0.77% error on average across 10 battleground states -- his average suggested margin of error was 2.9%

That's pretty fuckin' good. His biggest inaccuracy was understating how accurate his predictions were. 

Here's an album of charts of how he did, with his margins of error included. I haven't seen it anywhere, so I had to make it.

I think it's a mixture of PR (projecting confidence to inspire supporters) and magical thinking.

Maybe he forget to wear the magical underpants required to support such thinking?

When people were talking about it last night, it sounded as if Rove was being a wild card, was doing the unexpected. Doesn't that mean the whole thing was a set-up? Am I missing something?
They could have planned for the possibility of having some sort of check-in with the numbers people at some point. It seems pretty unlikely that the plan beforehand was for Rove to dispute the numbers.

Thanks Homeboy Trouble. I'm a little tired of all the "OMG Nate Silver got 49+ states right!!" hysteria going around the net, since anyone just averaging the polls yesterday (like Sam Wang or Drew Linzer) would have gotten the same results. Checking how close his actual margins are is a good start to actually evaluating his predictions meaningfully.

The interesting thing about his model is what it thought of the race in July, not what it thought in November. But nobody's saying anything about that.

A Romney adviser partly blames last night’s defeat on a weak message. “Turnout was the big problem, since we didn’t get all of McCain’s voters to the polls, but we really should have been talking more about Benghazi and Obamacare,” an adviser says, speaking on the condition on anonymity. “Those are major issues and Romney rarely mentioned them in the final days.”

So long as the Republican Party endorses (and enacts) voting laws designed to make it harder for registered voters to vote, so long as Republican officials like Ohio's Jon Husted contort themselves to interpret those laws in a restrictive fashion, the Republicans will continue to play a loser's game.

The GOP’s Horrible California Nightmare:
If preliminary results hold, 2012 will mark the first time in 80 years that either political party in California has enjoyed super-majority control. Republicans everywhere should be paying close attention. Because the demographic trends that led to Obama’s reelection — the increasing diversity of the electorate, the relative liberalism of the youth vote, the declining influence of old white males — made their national debut in California in the late 80s and early 90s. The rest of the nation is just catching up.

Right. The trouble is that it's hard to evaluate estimates of that sort of long-range uncertainty. 

If right before the election someone says "things are looking good for So-and-so right now" and then So-and-so wins the election the next day, we can be like "okay, this is evidence that your model works."

If someone in July says "things are looking good for So-and-so right now," and then So-and-so commits some horrible gaffe in October and eventually loses, then what do we say? Intuitively, if So-and-so would have won had he not committed the gaffe, we want to say that the model was right. On the other hand, if So-and-so would have lost anyway, we want to say that the model was wrong. But since we don't have a time machine or a way of traveling to parallel universes, we can't check what would have happened. All we know is what did happen.

Not a proud moment to be a white male... 

This has clearly been responded to here already, but I can't resist.

I'm a white male. I am extremely proud today. The guy that I "hoped" for years ago will still get to try to fix this mess. The propositions I voted for went the way I wanted (mostly): They won't be able to cripple my union, my wife's school might get more money, and Mercury Insurance won't get to mess with people's insurance rates. My congressperson, a lifetime politician and tea party supporter is probably going to lose his seat (my guy is up by 200 votes out of 30-40k right now).

Nationwide people came together to support civil rights for women, gay marriage, and legalization of a plant. And hope.

If you read Ari Fleischer's tweets during the counting (he was aggregated in CNN's live feed, don't you judge me) every single time an exit poll came in with more self-identified Democrats than Republicans, or a high percentage of youth voters, he shot out something smug involving the word "oversample."

benito.strauss, wow, I did not catch that. Now, one could suppose they just rehearsed the general idea of interviewing the numbers guys, except that they had just said they were going to bring one out and sit him next to Rove. Weird, though, that she mentioned exactly where the wireless audio link cut out. That was not a straightforward walk from the studio, yet she turned at that hallway and there was a camera ready to pick her up at the other end (although the crew that had come from the studio then pulled out of shot). Some of this suggests maybe it wasn't a setup, but it really does feel like they scripted, at least vaguely, PUNDIT BLOWS UP AT NUMBERS GUYS, and then filled in the details. This is oh-so-calculating FOX after all.

Based on ThinkProgress’ review of all ballots counted so far, 53,952,240 votes were cast for a Democratic candidate for the House and only 53,402,643 were cast for a Republican — meaning that Democratic votes exceed Republican votes by more than half a million.
So I guess it is meticulous gerrymandering that's keeping the Republicans in charge. My understanding of gerrymandering is that you're playing with fire by spreading your concentrated partisans around a bunch of districts (something like turning two 75% districts into 3 ~50% districts), so maybe 2014 does become a "wave" election for Democrats.

So happy to be in Maine and to have been part of the backlash against bigotry and victory for marriage equality in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington state.

Plus it's a good kick in the teeth of that sanctimonious schmuck, Frank Schubert, the chief strategist behind Prop 8 in California, a 2009 referendum to overturn a same-sex marriage law in Maine, and the passage of a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage this year in North Carolina.

From the Oct. 9 NYT, One Man Guides the Fight Against Gay Marriage:
The task is to extend that unbroken record of ballot victories in four states where, he notes, gay rights advocates are sure to outspend him. “To be sure, these are all deep blue states, so no doubt we have a challenge,” he said. “That said, at 32-0, I still like my chances.”
That would be 32-4 now, asshole.

This is all kinds of awesome.

How Conservative Media Lost to the MSM and Failed the Rank and File

Barack Obama just trounced a Republican opponent for the second time. But unlike four years ago, when most conservatives saw it coming, Tuesday's result was, for them, an unpleasant surprise. So many on the right had predicted a Mitt Romney victory, or even a blowout -- Dick Morris, George Will, and Michael Barone all predicted the GOP would break 300 electoral votes. Joe Scarborough scoffed at the notion that the election was anything other than a toss-up. Peggy Noonan insisted that those predicting an Obama victory were ignoring the world around them. Even Karl Rove, supposed political genius, missed the bulls-eye. These voices drove the coverage on Fox News, talk radio, the Drudge Report, and conservative blogs. 

...

Conservatives were at an information disadvantage because so many right-leaning outlets wasted time on stories the rest of America dismissed as nonsense. WorldNetDaily brought you birtherism. Forbes brought you Kenyan anti-colonialism. National Review obsessed about an imaginary rejection of American exceptionalism, misrepresenting an Obama quote in the process, and Andy McCarthy was interviewed widely about his theory that Obama, aka the Drone Warrior in Chief, allied himself with our Islamist enemies in a "Grand Jihad" against America. Seriously? 

Conservatives were at a disadvantage because their information elites pandered in the most cynical, self-defeating ways, treating would-be candidates like Sarah Palin and Herman Cain as if they were plausible presidents rather than national jokes who'd lose worse than George McGovern.

...

On the biggest political story of the year, the conservative media just got its ass handed to it by the mainstream media. And movement conservatives, who believe the MSM is more biased and less rigorous than their alternatives, have no way to explain how their trusted outlets got it wrong, while the New York Times got it right. Hint: The Times hired the most rigorous forecaster it could find.

If preliminary results hold, 2012 will mark the first time in 80 years that either political party in California has enjoyed super-majority control. Republicans everywhere should be paying close attention. Because the demographic trends that led to Obama’s reelection — the increasing diversity of the electorate, the relative liberalism of the youth vote, the declining influence of old white males — made their national debut in California in the late 80s and early 90s. The rest of the nation is just catching up.

Back in 1971, when I did 6th Form Geography, our teacher put great emphasis on the saying, "What happens in California today, happens the the rest of the United States tomorrow, and the rest of the world the day after."

The difficulty is, our side is right and their side is ignorant.

Rory, Believing that one side has a monopoly on being right has the potential to lead to overreach. And honestly, you don't get into politics if you want to be right all the time. By the very nature of the American political system, we're going to have big tent parties that have various factions that form coalitions because internal differences between two factions are less than the differences a faction has with the opposing party. And these coalitions can live with these internal contradictions as long as they have a common enemy or cause. And these contradictions also mean that neither side, to butcher Lincoln, is going to be always right all the time.

Prediction for 2016: FoxNews.com introduces their own official poll analysis blog to compete with FiveThirtyEight... Austin Gold, with his signature prediction index, the Gold Standard. He prominently claims the "mainstream" meta-media has a meta-liberal meta-bias. Nate Silver adds him to the list of statistically insignificant pollsters, prompting great handwringing from the right-wing press. Their continuing disagreement becomes part of the narrative fabric of the 2016 election, and most voters come to perceive both as partisan mouthpieces.

Election day approaches, and mysterious new adjustments cause Gold's numbers to more closely reflect Silver's. This shift is rationalized as the result of illicit voter registration practices by left-leaning organizations.

When a video surfaces of Jon Stewart joking with several Daily Show writers about challenging Republican voters to a kickboxing match, Stewart is forced to apologize, and The Daily Show opts to refocus its coverage on the ongoing media circus surrounding Kate Middleton's nipslip at a funeral for the victims of a mass shooting at Westminster Abbey.

On November 8th, the election results come in with a 97% sweep by Republican candidates because fuck it, it sure is a lot of hassle to try to subtly manipulate the media when you can just make shit up at the last minute.

This is true, but American liberals generally doubt themselves a lot more than American conservatives do. This leads to asymmetric polarization as Republicans, armed with their certitude, steamroll self-doubting Democrats. You see this in the media landscape, you see it in the legislative sausage-making, and you can even see it in the pollsters -- the conservative pollsters were all certain there would be a Romney victory, whereas Nate Silver devoted much of his 538 content to explaining all of the ways his model could be wrong. And I don't expect him to be doing the victory lap that the wingnuts would have been doing if they had nailed it.

John Boehner Welcomes Big Deficit Deal, Pledges to Work with President Obama

"byproduct of a growing economy," and he emphasized that "to garner Republican support for new revenues, the president must be willing to reduce spending and shore up the entitlement programs that are the primary drivers of our debt." 

It would be nice if the more moderate Republicans just blame the election on the Tea Party, compromise with the President, and make a deal that involves raising taxes on high incomes. I think they are making a mistake if they continue to bow to the Tea Party and Norquist. I doubt the Tea Party has the power it had when Obamacare "death panel" phobia was sweeping across the country, and if it does there comes a time when an elected official needs to do what's right for the country even when it costs him/her his/her job.

The thing I'm scared of is the economy goes south again, and the GOP decides to wait out another 2 or 4 years hoping to take back power.

I spent much of today driving around rural Mississippi and listening to the local talk radio. Schadenfreude is so delicious.

There is a whole lot of crazy out there and the knives are being sharpened and the pistols cocked for the circular firing squad already. The Republican Party as we know it is finished as a single entity. We will have a third party, not because someone manages to bring one up against all the barriers that exist, but because we will lose the Republican party as it's currently known.

The FRC guys think the Republicans lost because they weren't conservative enough and the "blue bloods" need to be kicked out. The pundit class (those "blue bloods" I suppose) think (I'd say correctly) that their primary process forces their candidates too far to the right. They all recognize that this was a disaster, but have no points of agreement at all as to why it happened. It's the collision of two separate fantasy spaces neither of which is reality.

I heard Herman Cain being interviewed by a fundie Christian pontificating with great seriousness on the necessity, against the definite difficulties ("We will need fifty coalitions, one for each state"), of forming a third party.

Hard times are still to come for all of us. Rear guard actions will be fought at every political crossroad. But make no mistake: Change is a motherfucker when you run from it. And right now, the conservative movement in America is fleeing from dramatic change that is certain and immutable. A man of color is president for the second time, and this happened despite a struggling economic climate and a national spirit of general discontent. He has been returned to office over the specific objections of the mass of white men. He has instead been re-elected by women, by people of color, by homosexuals, by people of varying religions or no religion whatsoever. Behold the New Jerusalem. Not that there’s anything wrong with being a white man, of course. There’s nothing wrong with being anything. That’s the point.

about which major policy issue are the Republicans "right" and the Democrats "wrong," requiring even more concessions to the GOP version of reality? 

So, are you saying that Nixon should not have made an overture to China, and Reagan should not have granted amnesty to undocumented immigrants?

Remember, I said "neither side is always right all the time", which is taking a longer term view. The Republican Party did have ideas on carbon taxation, health care reform, and immigration reform that were much more balanced that what is going on now.

I'm also talking about 10, or maybe 20 years down the line when another Republican is elected president. Most of us will be alive here. Some of us, as horrible as it sounds, may have even voted for him or her. When that happens, I would like to think I'm able to engage in some self-reflection on why there was a loss and what changes need to be made to win the next time.

Because just to be clear I consider myself more rational than liberal.

And I consider myself to be more Confucian than liberal, so there you go.

Its been said before - but it can't be said enough - that if we really want to keep our eye on the proverbial prize, we need to starts thinking of 2014. Not only that, we have to get some active, engaged and intelligent people to run for offices at the state level everywhere. 

What just happened in Wisconsin - the Republicans taking back uncontested control of the Senate - is a disaster. We get all distracted due to the sexiness of a presidential campaign and miss the piles of money pouring into our state races (thank you, Citizen's United) to mess with our local politics.

And, ultimately, local politics has as profound an effect on us as national politics. Indeed, our local politicians sometimes becomes our national politicians. 

Anyhow, if this election left you stirred up, don't stop feeling that way just because Obama won. Get on top of your local senators, reps, councilmembers, selectmen, what-have you. Don't leave those positions to crazy, stupid people with too much time on their hands.

Joey, that was more about redistricting than campaign spending, as far as anyone I talk to (e.g. in our local county Democratic/OFA office) understands it. The GOP made damn well sure that just about every safe blue seat was cut up into two or more districts -- in a process so secret that the law firm they contracted wouldn't give out information to anyone but the State Senate Majority Leader (a Republican). In any case, those victories were not for lack of organization or motivation on our part, either. The local party structure has probably not been this strong in years.

I meant to express sympathy for Dems in Wisconsin - most especially those who worked to hold on to the Senate and House in the state - and to encourage more progressives (everywhere, but in Wisconsin too) to get involved to help prevent more painful situations like the one in your state.

We're busy saying "oh yay Citizen's United didn't have the impact we thought it would" just because Obama won, but the impact of it can be painfully felt in dozens of local house and senate races. We need to stay organized and engaged so we can prevent the Republicans from getting to a position where they can Gerrymander the hell out of states. When we lose interest or drop our guard, that's when bad shit goes down.

Anyhow, sincere apologies. I think I've read some things you've written about your work in Wisconsin and I really shouldn't have suggested WI Dems aren't working their butts off to prevent disaster.

So, are you saying that Nixon should not have made an overture to China, and Reagan should not have granted amnesty to undocumented immigrants?

No, I was referring to the current century's GOP. Reagan and Nixon were open to rational thought. It was a different era and politicians were held to higher standards I suppose

You can keep Confucianism. Really, I think of my politics as neither liberal nor conservative but scientific and rooted in secular humanist values. Don't need any religion but that does not force me be a relativist.


Hell, I'll admit Mitt Romney had some good ideas. As many pointed out, he was forced to disown them to win the GOP primary. The moment I realized how dangerously amoral he was was in the early primary debate where he declined to indicate an acceptance of basic tenets of biological evolution.

That's either stupid or amoral for an educated man auditioning to be in charge of a science-driven society. Confucian, Mormon, whatever, don't piss on my leg and tell me it's fucking raining.

Joey Michaels, I didn't mean to imply, either, that you had implied that. I just wanted to give my impression from the boots on the ground. We still feel we did a great job last night, getting Tammy into the Senate and making sure that some local Assembly races were appropriately filled with Democrats, and in Paul Ryan's House race, we got his percentage below 55% -- a healthy 7-point drop from his usual re-election margin. But we had a lot of other counties where things didn't go as well on the down-ticket races. Believe you me, many of us can't figure out how our bluish-purple state has managed to go so red.

Where that Citizens United money went, my recycling bin and answering machine memory card can tell the tale -- easily over a hundred mailers, maybe 200 calls counting uncompleted messages -- spent on GOTV and voter contact in this, a reliably Democratic household. Couldn't figure it out, and maybe could have cut down on some of it if we didn't screen everything. I didn't see the airwave ads, but there were plenty of those too. And "beloved" Tommy lost big.

The problem with looking at what Silver was saying in July is that votes are not preordained and what happens in July, August and so forth matters.

One educational aspect of Nate Silver is that he doesn't just give numbers, but he also writes extensively about sources of uncertainty, statistical trends etc. It was the day before the VP debate when Obama's numbers were the lowest they had been for a long time; I trusted in 538's explanations about reversal to the mean (and MeFi's enthusiasm for Biden) and, long story short, this weekend's nights out will be financed with the money of Romney supporters.

Here's an interesting bit from that link on California's supermajority posted upthread. It will be interesting to see if money can be raised and diverted to infrastructure/education in a way that provides a good counterargument to the big-government boogeyman. Prop 13 has already proven that states/countries need to be able to raise revenue. Even a Tory MP was agreeing with that on tv about a week ago and Tories aren't exactly Marxists.

Because the true significance of the new Democratic Californian supermajority is that, at least for a couple of years, it finally releases Californians from the shackles of Proposition 13, the state initiative passed in 1978 that so severely limits the legislature’s ability to raise taxes and govern effectively.

What the Republican party really needs to do is support campaign spending limits both internally and in elections. Seriously. Right now Republicans think that extra spending translates to extra votes, and they think this is a good thing. They're right, but they're missing the big picture. They've worked themselves into a position where they're highly dependent on silly amounts of money. The only way they can collect this much is by prostituting themselves both at a policy and a preselection level. This is why they ended up with (a) incoherent policies that nobody except multi-millionaires wanted; and (b) Mitt Romney. 

What they have failed to realise is that campaigning isn't all about promoting your candidate. There has to be a product there too; you can't polish a turd. They need serious policy and candidate development mechanisms, and they can't afford to sell these out in exchange for more financing. There's definitely a level at which funding reflects genuine support: policies and candidates that can't attract sponsors are doomed in any case. But beyond that point you risk having policies that are attractive only to a small group of highly-committed supporters, and candidates (e.g., McMahon) who attempt to buy their position.

Turning off the money tap will be very, very hard, but it's the only way the Republicans will be able to put decent candidates forward. I'm not as down on Bush II as most people here, but it's fair to say that there were better choices. John McCain was past his use-by date, but he was an adequate candidate. But Sarah Palin? Mitt Romney? Paul mucking Ryan?! Not one of them had a reputation for policy development or a political history which would encourage confidence in them. They're shallow caricatures of a Hollywood President or VP; the sort of candidate put forward by an advertising agency. 

I think these two things would help the Republicans enormously, maybe even in the short term: introduce tight, very tight limits on the amount and type of promotion that can be used in support of candidates and policies internally; and support campaign financing limits for elections generally. This would reduce the impact of lobbyists and help the party focus on developing sound policies and electable candidates instead of seeking support from multi-billionaires and finding ever more photogenic VPs. Because at the moment the Republican Party is a joke; and all the theatre in the world is useless when people jeer at your policies and laugh at your candidates.

The problem with looking at what Silver was saying in July is that votes are not preordained and what happens in July, August and so forth matters.

Just to call back to this earlier business. Silver's model is all about the polls. Polls can change. To evaluate his model on what the polls were saying in July tells us less about his model than it does about the polls in July. As we all saw, under the model, when Obama did poorly (as perceived ... not to rehash) in the first debate, his forecasted election chances plummeted. I don't think Silver would ever say that his model should be evaluted by its four-months-out prediction in particular if conditions change and the polls head in a different direction.

My own preference (a gut preferenced) has long been for the Lichtman Keys to the White House model [previously] -- a system that Silver derisively dismissed. But Lichtman's system predicted an Obama win two years ago. The reason I like the system is sort of the opposite from why I also like Silver: it utterly ignores the polls and the vagaries of the campaign; in fact, it boldly suggests that campaigns may not even matter. (Since the system was derived from computer modeling at one level, this wasn't a forced world view, but a natural conclusion from it.) Just as Silver rpeatedly warns not to look at individual snapshots, Lichtman's system says not to look at snapshots at all. I'm not going to say that either approach is 100% correct, but they both, interestingly, came to the same conclusion. The big difference is that Silver would never make the claims that Lichtman does; he's not in that same business. To Silver's model, what is happening now is more important than anything that's happened in the previous four years, and personally I think that's a way to reduce the entirety of our politics to something like a popularity contest -- even if it works.

The Keys view, on the other hand, would say that the fundamentals of an Obama re-election were in place long ago, and while a Black Swan type of event could change that and break the model (changes are accounted for within certain parameters, e.g. Benghazi could potentially be counted as a Foreign Policy Failure and turn a key against Obama), it's much less likely. At least, the model has proven itself in every election since, I think, 1984. The one "exception" is when it predicted a Gore victory, but the model was optimized for the popular vote rather than the electoral college.

I just dropped in to add something to mark the fact that I watched this thread from the first few posts until I was overwhelmed and had to drop out while I focused on the TV coverage. I truly attempted to keep up with you wonderful MeFites but you just left me behind. I watched, totally captivated by the television coverage, switching across the broadcast networks until that momentous announcement that Ohio was declared for our President. It was the announcement that, at that point, it was mathematically impossible for Romney to win the election that propelled me from my supine position to call my wife across the country and to share my happy dance from my hotel room with her. I’m here in New Jersey helping support the hurricane disaster relief work and she’s in California continuing her work at the ‘Disaster Control Center’. That’s a ridiculous name isn’t it – control disasters? The name itself should make it clear that it’s with the federal government. 
I continued to watch, riveted to the television, repulsed by the Faux network response, and switching between PBS and MSNBC. I waited for Romney’s concession speech, and continued to wait. Hadn’t prepared a concession speech? So arrogant, so self assured that they were the chosen heirs that they never considered not winning was even a possibility. Finally – the triumph, we won! My investments, minor as they were, had in some small way contributed to the end result. 
The climax was that energetic, profoundly moving speech. What a wonderful night.
Starting early this morning I endeavored to read through all of the postings in this thread to look for the sharp insights and wonderful wit of the MeFite community. It’s been a work day and the only thing that carried me through was espresso double shots and the emotional uplift of sharing the delight of the election results with a small group of co-workers. I have finally finished reading the posts. Thank you all for contributing to making MetaFilter delightful.

I sincerely hope so. Prop 13 has been absolutely terrible for California public education. Californians have gotten complacent about the quality of their public universities especially, and don't seem to understand that the reason UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, etc. are such nationally and globally well-ranked and well-regarded schools is that the state shelled out the money for them. Our UCs can't continue to remain competitive if we don't fund them. 

My California history professor was always cranky about how California voters always voted themselves "more services and fewer taxes." It's kind of heartening to see that trend reverse just a little.

There has to be a product there too; you can't polish a turd. 

As close as the results were, the Republican brand seems very badly wounded by its unceasing and unapologetic pandering to social and religious extremists. A majority of women and minorities will likely associate this political party with rape, racism and general belligerence for a generation or two, and as the voting demographic continues to shift away from social extremists to a more diverse base, Republicans may likely find it harder to get votes.

Die-hard Tea Party loyalists are already jumping from the sinking GOP ship, and a number of the millionaires along the social policy axis had already jumped over to Ronpaulian and Libertarian alternatives. Despite this, Republicans are still upset that Romney didn't double-down on the fear-mongering, racism and bigotry — "true conservatism" — and so it seems unlikely they learned much from losing.

Whatever happens to the GOP, however, it seems improbable that either Republicans or Democrats will agree to implement campaign finance reforms that limit corporate donations. Certainly, Republicans have cast the matter of corporate financing as a defense of "free speech". That's a view that will be tough for a party of ultrapatriotic, superhawkish, pro-business types to reconsider — it would pretty much mean redefining the party brand almost entirely. Maybe it will come to that, though. And the DNC are just hypocrites on the subject, loudly complaining about Citizens United while continuing to cash the checks. So it goes.

All it will really take is a more convincing moderate Republican candidate, perhaps a Romney without all the Montgomery Burns associations, and with the ability to connect to minority voters such as Latinos.

Romney seems like the platonic ideal of all that is wrong with conservatism and the electoral process. It was made very clear that he has nothing but contempt for half the population. And yet people still voted for him in droves. It astounds me.

Not to be a downer and stuff, but: me too. It honestly and seriously does boggle my mind, as does the reality of so many people voting (out of tribal loyalty? because of misinformation? media failure? advertising dollars? the failure of education? why?) in ways that are directly counter to their own best interests.

Then again, I've had the same reaction (even if the villains and heroes are less clearly painted) to recent Canadian elections, too, so I just don't know any more.

I would hope the closeness of Bachman's and other tea-baggin' congresspeople's elections serve notice that they do not have a mandate. In all seriousness, Bachman's district was even more conservative under redistricting with the liberal Stillwater being placed under Phyllis Khan, so the fact that Graves, with way less money and name recognition, getting that close to defeating her should serve as a nuanced notice. Democrats in the House of Representatives need to get the backbone that this election provides.

For some reason, while watching the MSM talk about how Obama has to reach across the aisle and be amenable to the Republican House, the scene from Pulp Fiction arises where Samuel L. Jackson's voice booms with the paraphrase, "Do you think Barack Obama looks like a bitch?" In all seriousness, Obama holds the cards right now, and the realization that maybe negotiating with people who don't want to save the system but want to destroy it gives one a sense of fortitude.

I look at the plus side of Bachman's victory, it is good for fund raising and gives Democrats something to aspire towards.

I don't think Obama and the Dems should even shut down the monster. Why not just move the whole campaign engine over to his presidential staff and caucus directly with the people. Half the people didn't vote for him so it might do us some good to hear them out a bit.

We delt them a pretty nice blow, but why give them any time to recover and come up with a plan. Keep up the pressure. Run the next 4 years like he managed his campaign.

The people and the administration could work directly, congress would have to follow. Take charge of it.

I have a fondness for watching Fox News at times like this that leads to some conflict between me and my wife, but here's what I was able to glean from the bits of Hannity that she wasn't able to find an excuse to make me mute:

1) Ann Coulter denies that the country might be center-left
2) Ann Coulter is sad that the country was "denied the benefit of Mitt Romney." Expressing more affection for Romney that the cumulative opinions of every Republican before he lost.
3) Herman Cain is running a website called jobcreatorssolutions.com now. The website is confusing and seems mildly broken, but I'm sure as hell not turning off Noscript to see what it actually looks like.
4) The real story of the election is that Melissa Joan Hart got shit on twitter for saying she was voting for Romney.*
5) Herman Cain might think that Sean Hannity's name is John.

Throughout the campaign, it seemed nearly everything my Republican relatives posted on FB was not pro-Romney, it was anti-Obama. The usual socialism, welfare-state, handout Sugar Daddy nonsense. Coupled with some really appalling shit about Michelle Obama being a "Hoochie Mama" (ugh!) The only exceptions were my Mormon in-laws who also posted nice trite things about what a good man Mitt was, so dedicated to service, etc. 

I always took it as a good sign for my side that the GOP never really worked up a lot of enthusiasm for Mitt. But going forward it doesn't change much- there is still a good chunk of the country that hates Obama. 

So I am looking forward to seeing which of the rising stars comes up in 2016- Elizabeth Warren? Julian Castro? Deval Patrick? Cory Booker? Bring it. Let's see some heads explode.

Everyone talks about swing-states, but for me, the real story seems to be how many states have become dark blue (and dark red, obviously; heck, except for Georgia, I don't see a single light red - weak GOP- state at all!) between 2004 and 2012. Fascinating, absolutely fascinating.

Why the Out-Party’s “Bench” Always Seems Stronger Than It Is
Equally important is the relatively low standard in the GOP for what it takes for be considered a potential national candidate these days. A Republican politician can be in office for all of a few months, he can have no accomplishments to his name, and he will nonetheless become the subject of speculation about his prospects as a vice presidential or presidential candidate. This speculation will often begin by the end of his first or second year in office. As we’ve seen in the case of Marco Rubio, it can begin as soon as he is sworn in. Longer-serving politicians that have been unable to get any major legislation passed will be feted as “leaders” in their party because they happen to say the right things. When that is what it takes to become a “leader,” it shouldn’t be a surprise if the party seems to be filled with them.

She sums up a lot of how I feel about the election after the fact. I mean, the only real disappointment I have is that we still have the death penalty in California. Otherwise, the propositions pretty much all were OK, San Diego didn't elect a sociopath for mayor (seriously - the losing canidate is openly gay and was booed in the local pride parade), and despite having to defend a ton of seats the Dems actually gained ground in the house and senate. And we won't have Joe Lieberman around any more.

Now, the Dems just need to pull almost as hard to the left as they dare on immigration reform so that Republicans are seen as obstructing it when they inevitably try to block it, and thus build on a lasting demographic relationship. Also, it would be nice if some Justices stepped down the next couple years - Breyer and Ginsburg at the very least, just so progressives can retain those seats for some time to come. Kennedy and Scalia stepping down would be great too, but probably too much to hope for.

i don't think there is much chance that either Hillary or Christie is the nominee.

Hilary Clinton will not run, because she would 70 years old on Inauguration day. It was very clear that she ran in 2008 because it was her last chance -- and her taking the Secretary of State role was her acknowledging that.

Christie will not run unless the Tea Party leaves the GOP, because he is currently the 2nd most hated man by the GOP. If the Tea Party does leave the GOP, he will not run because he cannot win -- nobody from the GOP will win in that situation. He also has no real pull in the south or the west, which pretty much means he has *no pull whatsoever*. The only reason he was considered was that the GOP was desperate for Anybody But Romney, and Christie wasn't nearly stupid enough to be the guy taking the fall this year. Unfortunately for him, he had a major storm wreck his state, and he dared to act like an adult and work with Obama. 

Christie will also not become a Democrat. He might become an independent.

2016, however, has the GOP wave, and it's a nightmare if Obama has a good second term and there's a decent Democratic candidate. 

What the Dems really need to do is OBAMA OBAMA OBAMA. Propose everything, do everything, say everything that pisses the Tea Party off. If they can get the Tea Party and GOP to split, it's game over.

Or more precisely, the right to slut without the responsibility of consequences. The famous "gender gap" isn't really a gap based on gender. The right overwhelmingly wins older and married women. The "gender gap" should more accurately be called the slut vote.

Why the Out-Party’s “Bench” Always Seems Stronger Than It Is

Bokmakiere, as a counter to that piece's main point, you might want to check this thread, in which a former Clinton advisor notes that Republicans are much better poised to win the Senate than Dems in 2014, "when Democrats must defend 20 of the 33 seats up for election." More generally, he notes the Dem bench was "decimated" across the country during the 2010 election, and hasn't recovered. It's an interesting and thoughtful take.

Christie will also not become a Democrat. He might become an independent.

Well, he sure doesn't have a chance in hell of winning a Republican primary ever again.

homunculus: "Maddow: Conservative Groups Funneled Millions Into 2012 Race And Have Almost Nothing To Show For It"

I enjoyed Rachel's show tonight, and let out a Muntz-esque "HA-HA!" during that segment, but I'm definitely not ready to declare that liberal ideas won out over an onslaught of big money.

The striking thing about this election was how cataclysmically bad the GOP nominees in big races were from top to bottom. I don't know if their bench was just empty after the 2010 wave election (though the presence of clowns like Crazy Joe Walsh in that class (again, HA-HA!) suggests that maybe it was empty back then as well) but it's hard to believe they can't come up with some generic Republicans the next time around that aren't so crazytown bananapants. Marco Rubio seems reasonably sane, and his ethnicity will probably work in the GOP's intended "hey, we gave you a black guy on the Supreme Court, and now here's a Latino nominee for President! Are we cool?" manner. Susana Martinez has ladyparts, and I hear that's an emerging minority that might some day be large enough to pander to. Plenty of cromulent GOP governors out there -- hard to believe any of them is as batshit insane as Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, or Herman Cain.

I guess what I'm saying is the left really REALLY dodged a bullet this year. The big money boys didn't stretch themselves too thin, and if that money got behind some less odious candidates, and was spent more wisely (it's not like the Obama campaign's methodology is a big trade secret or anything) all that the Democrats gained last night could be washed away. Not to mention that a candidate with the natural charisma of Obama doesn't come around every generation.

The silver lining is that, with a couple more SCOTUS nominees (assuming the Democrats hold the line and don't let the GOP mau-mau them into nominating a Bizarro Souter) a reversal of Citizens United is possible. Public financing is probably a pipe dream, but if we can at least get better disclosure rules in place and some sane limits on corporate donations, maybe the playing field won't be so slanted next time.

In short: "Let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet."

Dean Chambers of UnskewedPolls.com finally comes to terms with his totally unforeseeable failure:
It is important to remember that the notion on which the polls were said to be “skewed” was the calculation or projection that the turnout on election day would be something like 35 percent each of Democrats and Republicans. So when a poll included a sample of 44 percent Democrats and 38 percent Republicans, it was said to be skewed by six percent Democrats and the percentages were re-weighted for something like 35 percent of each and then the calculations lead to the “unskewed” results. What I was wrong on was the concept that the voter turnout would show something close to even in percentages of Democrats and Republicans who actually voted in the election.

Most of the polls I “unskewed” were based on samples that generally included about five or six or seven percent more Democrats than Republicans, and I doubted and questioned the results of those polls, and then “unskewed” them based on my belief that a nearly equal percentage of Democrats and Republicans would turn out in the actual election this year. I was wrong on that assumption and those who predicted a turnout model of five or six percent in favor of Democrats were right. Likewise, the polling numbers they produced going on that assumption turned out to be right and my “unskewed” numbers were off the mark.
"What do you know, I guess my patented method of pulling turnout models out of my ass turned out to be incorrect."

Joe in Australia, I live in Paul Ryan's district, and the "Lyin' Ryan" meme was already established for his substantive policy flubs, like the shell-game "Pathway to Prosperity". The sports claims were not substantive so became old news quickly, but figured into much of the media coverage of Ryan as a serial fibber. There was a lot of discussion about his convention speech claim that the Janesville GM plant had not actually closed in 2008 (because a small subcontract production line remained open), given that many of Ryan's own constituents knew very well that they had lost their jobs in December. And so forth. I think it may have been a key reason the Romney campaign seemed to de-emphasize Ryan on the ticket except to predisposed audiences. As far as I'm concerned the stories had enough coverage to have an effect on the narrow band of people to whom they would matter. Again, the sports records fibs were not in themselves substantive enough, they just pointed to Ryan's propensity to stretch the truth and that underlying (heh) character flaw became a running theme of coverage of his campaign.

I was wrong on that assumption and those who predicted a turnout model of five or six percent in favor of Democrats were right.

Wow, that's a lot more honest an admission than most on the right have made these last 24 hours.

Fox discovers constant lying isn’t consistently effective electoral strategy

Yeesh, indeed. I had to remind someone who passed around a "Democrat Dick Morris says Romney with 325 EVs" link that Morris famously quit the party back in ... 1988. Although I see he has quit it again or something. Some of us remember that when he worked for President Clinton he already had a reputation for advising Republicans, and it was that GOP insight that Clinton was using him for. So if anyone was thinking he was some Dem big-shot they were sorely mistaken -- he's pretty much persona non grata (Latin for "a complete joke") within the party circles I know. It's this solipsism that has infected the GOP badly this cycle, but of course it's a risk we all face in this era of self-selection of media sources.

Why the Out-Party’s “Bench” Always Seems Stronger Than It Is

I think the bench is a real factor, but it may be overstated. There are circumstances where outsider and/or fresh-face status can be an asset and while it helps to have a nominee with experience, in individual elections circumstances may dictate that there is a level of rejection or disgust with the incumbent party, the so-called "change election". That was certainly what 2010 seemed to be across the board -- it didn't matter much what the new candidates brought to the table, it mattered that the voters were firing the incumbents.

Quote of the Day: America's Billionaires are Pissed Off at Karl Rove

"The billionaire donors I hear are livid," one Republican operative told The Huffington Post. "There is some holy hell to pay. Karl Rove has a lot of explaining to do ... I don't know how you tell your donors that we spent $390 million and got nothing."....Rove was forced to defend his group's expenditures live on Fox News on Tuesday night, and will hold a briefing with top donors on Thursday, according to Politico.

This was huge, but this was the Senate Class of 2006. The 2014 election has the class of 2008 -- the Obama Coattails. That'll be just as hard, if not harder. We also have a ten year disadvantage in many states thanks to the GOP gerrymandering. 

I'll second that. Looking at the field, I don't see any obvious pickup opportunities from the GOP, but the Democrats, counting both freshmen and veterans in redder states, anywhere from four to eight could be vulnerable. It will be a mid-term and the average loss for the party holding the White House has been about -3.3 seats. If there are any Supremes considering retirement the next two years would be the time.

At least there'll be some chance of taking back a few of the 2010 wave seats in 2016 -- notably Mark Kirk (who got in on a plurality; there was a big Green/Libertarian vote) and Pat Toomey.

To be fair to Karl Rove - I know, I know - the billionaire donors didn't get nothing. 

Basically half of the electorate remains to be pissed off and on-message. To some extent or another, they're going to support attempts to frustrate Obama's agenda. It's not as sweet a deal as having the Presidency, but there are worse second places. 

Also, every campaign donation is a gamble. If they're angry that their candidate didn't win, then they should stay out of politics. 

Further, up until this point, the post-Citizens United landscape had made it appear as if Super PACs would be these unbeatable molders of public opinion. This is obviously not the case. Not to say that Super PACs won't be a threat in the future, but it's good news they're apparently just as likely to be phenomenal wastes of money. 

Finally, it's interesting to see these Super PAC donations in the context of that recent Baffler article about con artistry on the right wing. Once again, Karl Rove gets the money and the donors get the snake oil. This might as well have been a massive, but failed, Amway sale to the American public.

I addressed the billionaire backer's "predicament" in the Clinton speech convention thread:

Yes, but the people they've hired or given - given! - their money to want more money. It's looking a lot like a classic mercenary trap - you can't buy loyalty or dedication. The PACs and bundlers need to keep it close, to keep money coming in. If they're losing by a little bit, even better, as desperation loosens the purse strings. If they fail in the end, well, no skin off their back... think of Blackwater in Iraq. They're going for as much as they can as fast as they can and let the next election cycle take care of itself - the fools will probably be back with a bigger check and an even less electable candidate regardless of the result.

And the most puzzlingly, miserably hilarious part of it is that they think of themselves as courageous independent thinkers.

That's what is so insidious. I'm 37, and my grandfather is still alive. We have all but lost our relationship, because the GOP media machine has taken over his life. He was always a little cantankerous, but now no conversation can exist that isn't turned into bleating about the manufactured controversy of the day. It makes me very sad. Especially because this kind of thing is happening all over the country.

Christie: Well, he sure doesn't have a chance in hell of winning a Republican primary ever again.

Sure he does. They tend to have very short memories about people they kinda want to like. If Fox decides to reannoint him, he has a shot.

But as I said above, he would make an awesome democrat. There are a lot of middle of the road policies that he could co-opt from the GOP tent that would fit with the Democrats. But I tend to love me a centrist/realist, so maybe I'm just projecting my own preferences. I'd rather see the Democrats shave support from the middle of the opinion continuum, rather than a GOP that sheds its nutjobs to move a little closer to the middle.

In general, I agree with this….especially the Fox characterization. However, MSNBC has been skirting closer to own version of Fox style speculation in their broadcasts. Over the past year, each of the main hosts on their particular show have taken a bite from the Fox-Speculation-Reporting-Style apple with varying results. While MSNBC does try to at least keep a bit of objectivity, they very often descend into “hysteria reporting” most associated with Chris Matthews, but increasingly exhibited by all of the on air people.

Ultimately, I don’t care. I watched them on Election Night, and then it got turned off again. Besides, with a quick mashup of Jerry Springer Final Thought™ and an episode of Cheaters (with Joey Greco of course), I can generally approximate most of what is being reported as going on in Washington on a daily basis with not a whole lot of embellishment. And I can skip through the commercials.

I think they use representative sampling via exit polls. They sample some polling places, and get an idea of the demographics of the people they talked to. Then they compare it to the demographics of the precinct as a whole. If an area is 50% black and the voters they talked to were 40% black, they get a 10% offset. Then they look at the same information from all the other polling places and start trying to extrapolate trends. If that 10% offset seems fairly consistent across the board, they can safely say that black voters are 10% less likely to vote. Which they can then use against the demographics of the population as a whole to report what the voting trends of the whole population probably are.

Or something like that- the point is that good polling is about getting representative samples and repeatability.

http://whitepeoplemourningromney.tumblr.com/ was delicious. Thank you for that. Most of them remind me of my rich racist relatives down to every fucking detail. 

My mother was a radical who rebelled against her wealthy family, most of whom still live on the west coast, and with whom I only have to deal in a very limited way for the occasional funeral or whatever (and now that both of my grandparents are gone, that really means I don't have to ever see any of them again, which is fine). But this year they have peppered her with viciously racist emails -- all the usual right wing shit, most of it so stupid and ignorant as to be laughable. My poor mom (who is nearly as distant from the family as I am but much more polite) sends me these emails so I can send her back the relevant debunking links to Snopes or whatever. I mean we're talking Fred Rogers was a NAVY Seal and Barack Obama is a Jihadist who eats watermelon sandwiches level stuff. She continues, in her saintly mom way, to believe that if those idiots just knew the actual facts they might come around.

So I send her the links and bite my tongue. The fuckers know better than to include me on any of their lists (and besides I wouldn't know since they are to a one listed in my SPAM filters) but when Pres. Obama won on tuesday night I was seriously tempted to compose a letter to the lot of them formally resigning from the clan (a family name you might know well if you live in the Midwest, whence springs their fortune, associated with a popular consumer product). Just one fuck off email. I didn't do it because I didn't want to cause problems for my mom, as delicious as it would have been to compose that letter. 

These are people who live in gated community oceanfront homes in southern California, for the most part. They drive Lexuses and Lincolns that they replace every year. They wear ridiculously expensive clothes and throw lavish shindigs. They are church-going Protestants, although they evince not one whiff of a spiritual life in their everyday being (my mother rebelled specifically against this hypocrisy, becoming a deeply devout Christian and a hospice nurse who still works full time in her 70s and lives an ascetic life . . . when she lost power last week because of Sandy I teased her by asking her how she would even know since she barely owns anything that requires electricity besides her computer, which she only has because her kids made her). 

And they act so fucking entitled to their privilege. They casually disdain the poor, spout racist bullshit, mock education and ambition, and are wedded like a Hapsburg to FOX News. The family fortune came from farming (effectively) and banking (to a lesser extent) and it has enabled most of them to pursue "small" business entrepreneurship in practical fields like computer networking or interior decorating, modestly to very profitable but utterly lacking in any intellectual demands beyond simple business management skills, and very obviously opportunities leveraged by the family's generation's of capital. And yet to hear them talk you'd think they dug ditches for 30 years for minimum wage to get what they have. To hear them complain about the Lazy Mexicans while their Mexican-American staff stand silently waiting to clear the fucking table or park their cars (admittedly most of my experience comes from lavish post-funeral receptions) is something else. To have them assume I share these views (the ones who don't know me better, including most of my cousings) enough so that they confide an obviously racist sentiment is hideous. One of them said enough vicious shit about Muslims to me before I could get a word in edgewise that I just said "Allah Akbar" and turned on my heel and walked away at the last gathering too, after which she gave me this strange steely glare for the rest of the event. They really do wear their whiteness as a mantle of superiority to people of color. Even though at least a couple of them are obvious closet cases, they wear their homophobia proudly. Even though most have college educations (albeit mediocre ones) they disdain the idea of scientific authority. They are so comfortable in their ignorance and prejudice that it is simply shocking, and simply inexcusable given their advantages in life. These are not working-class Reagan Democrats. These are rich people. 

They look so much like the people in those pictures. They really do. I can see them when I look at those pictures. So for me it was really cathartic to see those plump, over-dressed, stiff-necked, preening, entitled, clueless white people -- the old guys in their glasses and jackets and the young stiffs in formal wear alike -- finally waking up to the fact that the rest of the world doesn't just automatically buy their bullshit anymore.

A study Wednesday by the Sunlight Foundation, which tracks political spending, concluded that Rove's super PAC, American Crossroads, had a success rate of just 1 percent on $103 million in attack ads -- one of the lowest "returns on investment" (ROIs) of any outside spending group in this year's elections.

I think there is still a period where the Republicans might moderate a little bit, there certainly will always be a faction of ultra conservatives. Not sure if it was mentioned but sounds like Boehner will at least face a challenge for leadership (and he should, and probably should lose as the Senate went from a probable pick up to a net loss). I think it is too early to say how the Republicans are going to react party wise. We are still in the emotional aftermath. 

I've said it before and I'll say it again: They need to kick out the overt racists, homophobes and the redefine rape branch (a good portion of the tea party in other words). Let them start their own far right wing party. Things can realign, the new republicans will lose a few elections, but more conservative Dems will eventually join them and the Ds and Rs will eventually rebalance.

Transcript of that great bit from Maddow last night: 

Ohio really did go to the president last night.

And he really did win.
And he really was born in Hawaii.
And he really is -legitimately- President of the United States.
Again.

And the Bureau of Labor Statistics did not make-up a fake unemployment rate last month.
And the Congressional Research Service really can find no evidence
That cutting taxes on rich people grows the economy.

And the polls were not skewed to over-sample Democrats.
And Nate Silver was not making up fake projections about the election
To make conservatives feel bad.He was doing math.

And climate change is real.
And rape really does cause pregnancy sometimes.
And evolution is a thing.
And Benghazi was an attack on us.
It was not a scandal by us.

And no one is taking away anyone's guns.
And taxes haven't gone up.
And the deficit is dropping, actually.
And Saddam Hussein didn't have weapons of mass destruction.

And the moon landing was real.
And FEMA isn't building concentration camps.
And UN election observers aren't taking over Texas.
And moderate reforms of the regulations on the insurance industry 
And the financial services industry 
Are not the same thing as communism.

Listen.

How did a Race that Wasn't in the Balance Convey the Impression That It Was?

I'm really not sure it wasn't. I'd be the first to critique this narrative, except that I think there was legitimate reason to be unsure. Romney got a lot of the vote for a supposedly unviable candidate. There were new funding structures in place. It was hard to get a read on the electorate. There was a ginormous weather event at the last minute. I do feel this was anything but predictable, no matter how much I deplore the media's obvious relish for the horse race.

Military Absentee Ballots Delivered One Day Late, Would Have Swung Election For Romney
WASHINGTON, DC – Sources confirmed today that hundreds of thousands of military absentee ballots were delivered hours after the deadline for them to be counted, with preliminary counts showing that they would have overturned the vote in several states and brought a victory for Governor Mitt Romney.

They said the black vote was about 10%, and the hispanic vote 10% (this was via Fox).
Are those totals?
How do they know the ethnicity of voters?

Looks like there is a thread on the exit polls now.

NYTimes has a nice summary of them--very interesting. Just for example, you could make the case that the gay/lesbian vote won the election (non gay/lesbian vote is exactly tied 49/49). Breakdowns by income, age, education, and many others are worth a look.

Miko: I do feel this was anything but predictable, no matter how much I deplore the media's obvious relish for the horse race.

The problem with this thinking is that Romney NEVER advanced to 270 EVs in any of the reputable poll aggregator or statisticians' models. Not sure whether you followed Nate Silver, Sam Wang, the betting markets or even the right-leaning RealClearPolitics, but this was never a race.

Even in the worst days, just after the first debate, the president's lead dropped, but he never fell behind in the electoral college, and the drop, while precipitous, didn't last more than a couple of days. After that, we saw reversion to the mean, and every reputable predictor predicted the race with astonishing accuracy.

So, really, it wasn't unpredictable, and it wasn't a horse race.

Obama won once. Result: Stunned disbelief by conservatives throughout the country. Four years of birther nonsense. Fox News apoplexy. Billions of dollars poured into the Republican party.

Obama wins twice. Result: The audible sound of minds breaking. People talking about holing up in Texas for the "last stand." Before long I'm sure we'll see conservatives walking in tight circles in the streets murmuring "it can't be it can't be."

Obama wins three times. Result: Well of course it's not possible. But we can perform a thought experiment, if it could happen, like imagining what it'd be like to travel near the speed of light. On hearing the news I think their brains would calculate 1/0 and they'd immediately burst into a cloud of smoke and flag lapel pins.

After all the denials and backtracking on the 47% speech, and particularly the pooh-poohing of the whole incident from the conservative media, explanations about how it was just a gaffe and a mis-statement and all that, it it is both hilarious and ironic to see both Palin and O'Reilly now giving EXACTLY the same explanation that Romney did in the 47% speech. 

I mean, it really couldn't be any more exact--even some of O'Reilly's very phrasing. Only difference is, now it is given the reason Romney lost and (per O'Reilly) it's now not 47% but 50% of the population.

Others have linked to this Rachel Maddow clip from last night, but here's the transcript if, like me, you often don't click links. The happy buzz of Tuesday night has already worn off for me, but hearing this put it back in a bit of perspective.

That happened! That really happened. We are not going to have a 
Supreme Court that will overturn Roe versus Wade. There will be no more Antonin Scalias and Samuel Alitos added to this court.
We`re not going to repeal health reform. Nobody is going to kill 
Medicare and make old people in this generation or any other generation fight it out on the open market to try to get themselves health insurance. 

We are not going to do that.

We are not going to give a 20 percent tax cut to millionaires and billionaires and expect programs like food stamps and kid`s insurance to cover the cost of that tax cut.

We're not make you clear it with your boss if you want to get birth control under the insurance plan that you're on.

We are not going to redefine rape.

We are not going to amend the United States Constitution to stop gay people from getting married.

We are not going to double Guantanamo.

We are not eliminating the Department of Energy or the Department of Education or housing at the federal level.

We are not going to spend $2 trillion on the military that the military does not want. We are not scaling back on student loans, because the country's new plan is that you should borrow money from your parents.

We are not vetoing the DREAM Act. We are not self-deporting. We are 
not letting Detroit go bankrupt.

We are not starting a trade war with China on Inauguration Day in January. 

We are not going to have, as a president, a man who once led a mob of friends to run down a scared, gay kid, to hold him down and forcibly cut his hair off with a pair of scissors while that kid cried and screamed for help and there was no apology, not ever.

We are not going to have a Secretary of State John Bolton. We are not bringing Dick Cheney back. We are not going to have a foreign policy shop stocked with architects of the Iraq war. We are not going to do it.

We had the chance to do that if we wanted to do that, as a country. 

And we said no, last night, loudly.


Now personally, I don't think that Romney would have done everything in this list that he said he would. But given that Bush governed completely to the right of everything he promised, there's no reason to think Romney wouldn't have been WORSE than he said he'd be. The relief I feel is palatable.

Also, I could probably get married in 20% of the states, with more to come eventually. So there's that. This is, of course, just the beginning of the work that needs to be done. But it will be a hell of a lot easier with the victories yesterday.

No that is not true at all. The Japanese Emperor is considered head of the State Religion, Shinto.

Further complicating things is that "State Shinto" wasn't an official religion (nor was Shinto a unified religion in really much of any sense) until the tail end of the 19th century, and despite their still being a "State Shinto" that conducts official ceremonies and stuff, Shinto is by no means monolithic, and there are plenty of versions, shrines, practices, offshoots, etc. that have nothing to do with state ceremonies or with the imperial house.

thanks cashman, assuming you meant my family exposé. I guess that was the letter I wanted to write to them. 

They're my family -- one side of the very idiosyncratic mix that made me who I am -- but I am so alienated from them I feel no loyalty to them whatsoever. And sometimes when we have these arguments about whether to be magnanimous or vindictive in victory (after years of experiencing only vindictiveness from the right in loss after loss) I try to take the high road. I don't believe that merely being Republican means you have surrendered your soul to the dark side, and I do believe that many people who believe in parts of the right wing ideological mix are suckered into supporting other parts that ought to be reprehensible to them (like, for example, how can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty, right?) by charlatans, con artists, demagogues, and hucksters who take advantage of ignorance and the propaganda resources they command to keep people in a state of rage and fear I wouldn't want to emulate. 

But when people who have everything talk that shit I can't find the sympathy. Maybe the order should be reversed, and my politics are my expression of rebellion, certainly I am my mother's son and inherited her revulsion at her milieu of origin. In many ways it shaped my career and my life. 

Maybe it just takes a few days to chill out. I was radicalized by my mother and my memory of politics stretches back to McGovern. I have never witnessed magnanimity in victory from the right in all that time. 

When Barack Obama made his offhand remark about voting as "the best revenge," I knew just what he meant. He meant this. At the time I thought he was specifically referring to avenging the voter suppression efforts which were the ugliest part of this year's election. But now I think he meant revenge for all of it, stretching back to Nixon and Goldwater and the Southern Strategy that continues to be the illegitimate basis -- and purely divisive one at that -- of the GOP's remaining hold on political power in the the US. 

And I want my schadenfreude. I want my few days of making them feel the weight and consequences of the way they have conducted themselves. I want revenge. And seeing them have a major sad (or seeing their heads asplode) is that. Laughing at it is that. Sorry. 

It may make me a bad person, and it is no doubt politically stupid. but it feels so damn good. They are bullies -- too many of them, anyway -- and bullies need to experience the pain they cause to change.

I have to agree. I feel the same way. While I am fast approaching the point where I am going to stop with the immediate rebuttal tactic that I use on other sites (not here though), I have consciously chosen to rub it in just a bit to those people who subjected me to their asinine and completely uninformed rants over the past 4 years. 

But there is a point of diminishing returns with this behavior not only as a way to make a point and a way to justify it all to even myself. Rather than dwell on what just happened and the delicious schadenfreude, it is time to move and be vigilant to the whatever these conservatives morph into. 

Schadenfreude is fine in small doses, but it has a bad habit of turning into hubris and that is never a good thing.

These aren't petty comments about her weight or her eyeliner or length of her skirt or whatnot, she looks sick (like Dick Cheney is, and Bill Clinton was, before the vegetables).

From kinnakeet's link:
"Did you catch Sarah Palin on TV tonight talking about politics, something she knows little to nothing about? Did you see her face and hair? What in the hell…

What is going on here? Is she on a bender? Like, a long one? And the hair? Did she literally stick her finger in a light socket? Is she wearing a thrift store wig? Who did she snatch that from?

This is what happens when you sh*t on the gays, Sarah. Who do you think does your hair and makeup?

Sashay away gurl."
I understand that you may not have intended to be petty, but that sure as hell was.

I try to take the high road. I don't believe that merely being Republican means you have surrendered your soul to the dark side, and I do believe that many people who believe in parts of the right wing ideological mix are suckered into supporting other parts that ought to be reprehensible to them (like, for example, how can you be pro-life and pro-death penalty, right?) by charlatans, con artists, demagogues, and hucksters who take advantage of ignorance and the propaganda resources they command to keep people in a state of rage and fear I wouldn't want to emulate.
I have a good friend who's quite intelligent. We've had numerous really interesting and engaging conversations about philosophy and comparative religion... his lifelong quest for enlightenment is admirable and enviable. He's a genuinely nice and more or less gentle person, good sense of humor, warm and caring when it comes to people within his sphere and community... yet he's got this batshit crazy right wing Mr. Hyde thing going on. He mostly keeps a lid on it in the real world, but I had to unsubscribe from his Facebook activity almost immediately after we connected there.

We don't usually talk politics, but a couple of weeks ago he made a comment that he'd come to the conclusion that it didn't really matter much who won this election. It was a calm, sort of resigned comment that surprised me but seemed to speak of a little bit of intellectual maturity and growth along those lines.

Well, he apparently worked himself back into a lather after watching Fox News in the days leading up to the election. Tuesday night I couldn't help myself, and took a peek at his Facebook feed. Upside down American flags, Ranting and raving about Obama voters deserving everything they're about to get and this once mighty Republic has fallen and let's get a list of all the traitors who voted for Obama (with the implication that this list will be used to round them up and put them against the wall) and people worship Obama as their messiah and Bolshevik socialists and and and WHARRGARBL. It's so completely infantile and cartoonish that I can shrug most of it off with an eyeroll, but it's also deeply troubling to me that this man who is capable of reason, insight and compromise in so many other domains has had this frothing jingoistic mindset so deeply implanted in him that he says these hateful, misinformed things with such apparent conviction. He himself has told me that he has had to overcome a number of prejudices passed onto him from his father, and I suspect this weird conflation of hawkish patriotism, uberconservatism, subconscious racism and mysogyny is one that he's not even aware of.

I'm not really seeing the difference between this perspective and a hypothetical GOP one rationalizing bullshit about Clinton's appearance by saying that the liberal media tries to make her into some kind of hard manhating battleaxe. It is still buying into the idea that it is ok to judge people by their gender presentation, which women are uniquely vulnerable to having no equivilent to the default options available to straight cis men. There are many things with what Sarah Palin tries to do, her presentation of gender is absolutely not one of them.

I have a good friend who's quite intelligent [...] yet he's got this batshit crazy right wing Mr. Hyde thing going on. 

usonian, that's a really scary comment. Reminds me of this from Robert Stacy McCain that got linked to earlier by octothorpe. 

What is left to hope for? That the American people will soon regret their choice? That another four years of economic stagnation and escalating debt will cure them of their insane appetite for charismatic liberals? If four years of endless failure have not rid them of this madness, the disease may well be terminal. Perhaps others will still see some cause for hope, and in another few weeks my friends may persuade me to see it, too. But today I will hear no such talk, and I doubt I'll be in a better mood tomorrow. At the moment, I am convinced America is doomed beyond all hope of redemption, and any talk of the future fills me with dread and horror.

Really despairing stuff except for maybe one sentence: "Perhaps others will still see some cause for hope, and in another few weeks my friends may persuade me to see it, too." It tells me that folks like this are a point where they really do need their friends. They're at a point where that great mansion they've long believed in has been revealed as a house of cards, and it's gone, it's doomed and they're blind to anything but the worst possible future. 

The temptation is to say, "nyah! nyah! nyah! reap what you've sewn, assholes" (I've certainly felt it) ... but seriously, that's not going to get anything accomplished, except maybe sew a few more seeds for future unresolvable divisions that will ultimately lead to some kind of violence.

Joey Michaels: "Also, Karl Rove's new position is that Obama suppressed the vote by running negative ads about Romney."

That's not surprising. Part of it is ongoing spin on Rove's part. But he's also been attacking negative ads in a bunch of campaigns all year, and while he's been focusing on the Democrats (go figure) he's also been less than positive about some of the loonier Republicans. That's not to say he's bipartisan in any way. His Super-Pac, American Crossroads GPS still supported Mandel and Mourdock monetarily right up to the election finish line.

Anyway, Rove was pretty vocal about the harm the birther movement could do to the GOP's chances during the primary and singled out Rick Perry, who was its face for a while. But his reaction to the Tea Party during its ascension to power has also been interesting and kinda weird. It's like he's trying to court them in a big way and also diminish their actual political influence. He reportedly pushed them to support a more moderate candidate over Christine O'Donnell in MD during the last election cycle. All while declaring that Tea Party isn't really all that extremist. 

Not an easy sell. I guess you go to the polls with the Tea Party you have, not the one you want or need.

SASHA OBAMA '32 for PRESIDENT OF EVERYTHING
posted by Joey Michaels at 1:07 PM on November 8, 2012 [34 favorites]


There are some things I think are interesting that haven't gotten a lot of discussion since the election result was announced. President Obama is about to start coming to the American people a lot more, engaging us, and needing us to get involved and help bust up this obstructionism, non compromise and so on.

Obama said on 60 minutes:
Kroft: How are you going to get (Republicans) to change their minds and make this deal?

Obama: I won't get them to-- make them change their minds. The American people will. I mean, ultimately, the American people agree with me that the only way we bring down our deficit is to do it in a balanced way. So, keep in mind, I've agreed with the Republicans. And we've already cut a trillion dollars of spending. And I've told them I'm prepared to do additional spending cuts and do some entitlement reform. But what I've said is, "You can't ask me to make student loans higher for kids who need it or ask seniors to pay more for their Medicare or throw people off of health care and not ask somebody like me or Mr. Romney to do anything, not ask us to do a single dime's worth of sacrifice."

...

Obama: Oh, I think that-- you know-- as president I bear responsibility for everything, to some degree and one of the things I've realized over the last two years is that that only happens if I'm enlisting the American people much more aggressively than I did the first two years.
CNN's post-election night coverage had them saying in talking with the president, he aimed to bring the case to the American people much more than in previous years. I couldn't find the exact segment where I saw it, but I did see this in a different part of their coverage, said by Gloria Borger:
I was told that the president, as early as the end of this week, may give some sort of economic speech or may hold some sort of availability to talk to the American public.
So the political threads may become much more frequent if this happens. Additionally, all those links, all that information, all those people you know who you avoided talking to, soon it will be time to talk to them.

Some people won't change no matter how much you talk to them, but I think the signs are clear that what is about to happen is that the President is going to depend on the American people who reject the obstructionism and lack of compromise to push through what needs to get pushed through, and to pressure politicians who represent us, to not be hardline obstructionists. 

I think some part of this involves talking to friends and family members and sharing stories. The president got re-elected thanks to the hard work of people all over the country, and in part on his own. 

For those who are in America, we need to spend some time sharing information, methods of contact, location of rallies and initiatives that need support from like-minded individuals, and airtimes of relevant events. 

We still need to have the president's back. It's not over.

Really despairing stuff except for maybe one sentence: "Perhaps others will still see some cause for hope, and in another few weeks my friends may persuade me to see it, too." It tells me that folks like this are a point where they really do need their friends. 

Check out this video. It's sappy and stupid but the point made around 20 minutes is true. She says you can hit people with data, articles, information and think that will make them change their minds, but it is stories that do it. We need to learn to talk to our friends, family and coworkers and tell stories that bring them into what we are seeing.

I've encountered this idea a bunch of times before, most recently with this video. I think it is time we start preparing for what will be increased responsibility on the part of Americans to not let republicans keep obstructing things and stopping the government from functioning properly. Maddow also talked about this last night in the video many of us watched. Keep an eye out for what happens in the next few months. I suspect the president will indeed reach out and ask us all to be informed, and to act.

I'm choosing another rather unique path; a personal boycott, if you will. Starting early this morning, I am going to un-friend every single individual on Facebook who voted for Obama, or I even suspect may have Democrat leanings. I will do the same in person. All family and friends, even close family and friends, who I know to be Democrats are hereby dead to me. I vow never to speak to them again for the rest of my life, or have any communications with them. They are in short, the enemies of liberty. They deserve nothing less than hatred and utter contempt.

I strongly urge all other libertarians to do the same. Are you married to someone who voted for Obama, have a girlfriend who voted 'O'. Divorce them. Break up with them without haste. Vow not to attend family functions, Thanksgiving dinner or Christmas for example, if there will be any family members in attendance who are Democrats.

I'm paying for my food with my own hard-earned dollars. And other people get their food for free." And I look around with disgust, making sure others in line have heard me.

Driving back from Jackson to NOLA today, and the right wing radio meltdown continues apace. I found el Rushbo's show just in time to hear him take a truly remarkable call from one of his own hard-liners (paraphrasing a bit from memory here):
Rush, I have decided I will never again pull the lever for one of these moderate Republican candidates. The Republican establishment can either start sending us candidates who reflect our conservative values or we will stay home.
...
If the Republicans want to be sure I will never vote for one of their candidates, all they have to do is say "I look forward to reaching across the aisle."
...
If the country is going over the cliff at 100 MPH with Obama or 70 MPH with Romney, I don't see the difference. All I can do is hope that the Republican establishment cares enough about my vote to field candidates who reflect my values.
This left Rush as flustered as Dr. Frankenstein realizing that his creation was no longer willing to listen to him. The right has demonized the left so thoroughly that the slightest (and most likely disingenuous) hint at conciliation is now seen as a fatal betrayal.

In the next half hour Rush went on a truly epic rant over the establishment's actual plan, which is to try and attract the women, Hispanic, and black voters who rejected them.
To get Hispanic voters -- it's not immigration policy, folks. These voters want to stay at home and get welfare. Do we tell them we're embracing the welfare state to get their votes?
...
Do we tell women that we'll give out free birth control pills and abortions to get their vote?
What made listening to this bearable -- even a bit giddy-making -- is that it was tinged with more than a slight air of obvious desperation. The Republicans have lost possibly several million voters who, now that they have cut the cord and tasted the sweet joy of voting for someone who can't win but at least doesn't make them feel dirty, will now happily enjoy their guilt-free martyrdom while the Republicans sail on without them. Left unsaid by Rush, though he obviously understands the problem, is that if the Republicans do what they need to bring back these voters, they will never win another national election and they will steadily lose the ability to lose statewide elections.

Fun facts: Mitt took bedrook red Louisiana and Mississippi with less than 60% each. And our hispanic and black populations are growing too.

I also listened a bit to Huckabee and Hannity, and the chaotic failure to cohere is a delight to behold. There is no agreement as to either why Tuesday happened or what to do about it, and some differences that will very certainly never be sorted. The Republicans are finished as a single party.

What's the over-under for whether it takes a week for this guy to get into an entry in Not Always Right?
Since there are over 6000 comments here already, this is probably a good place for me to make the pedantic rant I always want to make without it taking up too large a fraction of the thread with noise.

"Over-under" isn't jargon for "odds". It's a specific type of bet in which the bookie gives you a number and you guess whether some upcoming statistic will be over or under it. It's best for the bookie if both sides seem to have an equal probability of being right so the bets on both sides balance out. Examples of things you could set an over-under value for: "the total number of points scored in this upcoming football game", or "Romney's percentage of the popular vote".

So it doesn't really make any sense to say "the over-under for whether it takes a week". For a bet like that, the bookie would post odds instead, like 3-1 (bet one dollar, get three back if you win). So "the odds for whether it takes a week" would make total sense. So would "the over-under for how long it takes".

Summary: "odds" are about the chance a specific yes/no thing will happen; "over-under" is about the median likely result of a measured value.

The more you know!

"Over-under" isn't jargon for "odds". It's a specific type of bet in which the bookie gives you a number and you guess whether some upcoming statistic will be over or under it.

I know. That's why I specified a specific time, and was taking bets as to how much OVER or UNDER that time it would take for the event to happen.

God, oh god, I would so like to behind that dude in line when he rants about welfare. I've got a few things to say to him.

I had a little fantasy where the dude says his thing, turns to sneer triumphantly at the people in line with him...and sees that the guy right behind him, EBT card in hand, is a Silver Star-winning veteran who's lost a couple of limbs. And his (mom, boyfriend, best buddy) is there too, and they clock the a-hole in the chops. (Yes, in my fantasy, the vet is in his full dress uniform for some reason.) Then the jerk goes home and shuts the fuck up for the rest of his life.

Part of the problem with the fiscal cliff is that Boehner doesn't really have a caucus. He has a significant minority who, like the guy I quoted above who called Rush Limbaugh today, are ready to fold their arms and watch the cliff go by under them on principle. This is what collapsed the last attempted deal and resulted in the current deadline.

Boehner's other problem is that if he simply takes the reps who are loyal to him and the party elders and forms a coalition with the Dems to pass a fix, his own party will vote him out of the Speakership next year.

I guess Kermit was wrong and it really sucks to be orange.

Oh, another thing that came through especially from the small-station Christian fundie end of the radio spectrum, there seems to be an emerging theme that Obama's re-election is part of America's punishment for turning away from God in the matters of legalizing gay marriage, recreational weed, and banning prayer in schools and courthouses. So this acceptance of political loss is a kind of modern sackloth and ashes to be worn as they watch the flames grow, and instead of being scared into voting the heck out of anything that will fight those flames they are now God's terrifying but necessary purification. And besides anyone properly deserving will probably be Raptured at a properly "Nelson HA-HA" moment.

[I]t wasn't until the polls closed that concern turned into alarm. They expected North Carolina to be called early. It wasn't. They expected Pennsylvania to be up in the air all night; it went early for the President.

It's not just demographics that are killing the Republicans, although that's huge.

They've invested a lot of time and energy into becoming a party of martinets who can't advocate a plan without first fulfilling their need to lecture the rest of us on how totally and dismally incorrect we are about every-fucking-thing-under-the-sun. They've spent the last four years, especially, squawking and yelling - and they haven't stopped to actually listen to the citizenry. There's just no other reason for them being on the wrong side of so many social issues that have huge support. I mean, it's the 21st century and they are working doubletime to literally piss off as many women as possible.

You know, that's just fucking crazy! Think of it this way: Romney, the man who ran for President based on his bona fides as a great manager and business man, ran a ~$1 billion dollar campaign that not only didn't get done what it was made to do, but it was so flawed as an enterprise that it didn't even have a sense that it might be on the wrong road despite this being the conclusion of every poll aggregator on the web.

Yeah, I don't think this is true. I was listening to the radio all day from both campaign HQs, and the reporters consistently said there was a tense mood at the Romney camp and a restrained exuberance/confidence at Obama's. They certainly knew it didn't look good. They might not have been happy, but by the time the polls came out on Monday, they had to know only a bizarre miracle would have saved them.

I heard that night that the concession speech was so delayed because they were reviewing the ability to contest. They had teams of lawyers for each of four states ready to file contestations. I thought that was odd, but looked it up, and it turns out the Dems do this too for states that might be fishy. But they would have had to file so many contestations to add up to a victory that it would have looked like what it was, desperation.

It is quite hard to fathom that they would not have hired any political operatives with enough experience interpreting poll results to at least come to the (private and undisclosed) conclusion that they were in real trouble.

If they are actually claiming that, as opposed to authoring a narrative to keep the base in line, then it speaks to incompetence so great that it's nearly incomprehensible. It's not like Nate Silver was an actual wizard or read actual tea leaves -- all he was doing was interpreting the public polling data. I would expect the campaigns had mountains more data than Silver in the form of privately commissioned polls.

As soon as the bomb goes off, they'll come sniveling with "can I please get a tax cut" and "can I please get an aircraft carrier." We get cut, they get stabbed in the face 300 times. I'm not quite sure why Boehner agreed to it unless he knew that it would be impossible to get his party in line without them first being stabbed in the face.

I don't think it'll be enough of a blow to the economy to send it fully into major recession mode, so I'm not terribly worried even if they do refuse to back down.

TRANSCRIPT: Diane Sawyer’s Interview with Speaker of the House John Boehner

My guess is they will delay the fiscal cliff for a few months. Then brinkmanship on both sides with the President demanding tax rate increases and the house refusing them. Ultimately, the President will give in on rate increases in place of other "revenue" increases - maybe he'll implement a deduction cap as proposed by Romney and possibly changes to what can be considered capital gains? Basically, the Romney tax reform plan without across the board rate cuts or increases to military spending. Both sides could possibly claim victory, or at least deny defeat.

The United States Secret Service is investigating a Turlock woman over a post she made, using the N-word, about President Obama on Facebook. (and assassination)

“Another 4 years of this (N-word),” Denise Helms wrote. “Maybe he will get assassinated this term.”

...

The assassination part is kind of harsh,” Helms said. “I’m not saying I’d go do that or anything like that, by any means, but if it was to happen I don’t think I’d care one bit.”

FOX40 asked her to clarify.

“Really? It wouldn’t bug you if someone assassinated the president?” FOX40 asked.

“Well, it’s not something I would dwell on. It’s not something I would be upset about,” Helms responded.

...

I don’t understand what I did wrong. I didn’t say, ‘Hey, someone go do this,’” Helms told FOX40.

Helms also said that, despite using a racial slur, she doesn’t consider herself racist.

How the Secret Service Said Goodbye to Mitt Romney

Of all the indignities involved in losing a presidential race, none is more stark than the sudden emptiness of your entourage. The Secret Service detail guarding Governor Romney since Feb 1. stood down quickly. He had ridden in a 15-car motorcade to the Intercontinental Hotel in Boston for his concession speech. He rode in a single-car motorcade back across the Charles River to Belmont. His son, Tagg, did the driving.
...

But the Service leaves quickly. No more motorcades. No more rope lines. No more bubbles. Familiar faces disappear, never to be seen again.

In 2008, agents offered to see John McCain back to his ranch in Sedona, but McCain insisted on saying his good byes in his suite at the Biltmore Hotel. The next morning, McCain was seen driving his own car to get groceries.

A B-3 is a "paunchy middle-aged guy getting violently but harmlessly ranty at a sports bar." A Z-97y is "wannabe pundit blogger claims he meant it ironically but knows that we know he didn't but also knows we know he would never escalate beyond statements even given an empty room, no witnesses, a loaded gun, and a rock-solid alibi and is already twisting in shame about knowing we know it," etc.

People say this but I don't know if it would, at least in terms of actually preventing assassinations. It would be incredibly bad PR if someone said something like this, wasn't investigated and then attempted an assassination, but that's not the same thing as this being a good use of the resources devoted to protecting the US president.

Is a person who has indicated that they'd like someone to be assassinated measurably more likely to be part of a plot than someone who has indicated that they hate him, his race and his policies? I'd actually be interested to know the answer to that.

Blindsided, my ass.

Oh, I agree that there's a certain portion of the pundit class that has an actual passing familiarity with reality -- witness Krauthammer's completely unconvincing prediction right before the election that it would be "close," before claiming Romney would win. And of course FOX (and its ilk) is in the business of lying as cynically and as blatantly and as absurdly as they can:
In conservative fantasy-land, Richard Nixon was a champion of ideological conservatism, tax cuts are the only way to raise revenue, adding neoconservatives to a foreign-policy team reassures American voters, Benghazi was a winning campaign issue, Clint Eastwood's convention speech was a brilliant triumph, and Obama's America is a place where black kids can beat up white kids with impunity. Most conservative pundits know better than this nonsense -- not that they speak up against it. They see criticizing their own side as a sign of disloyalty. I see a coalition that has lost all perspective, partly because there's no cost to broadcasting or publishing inane bullshit. In fact, it's often very profitable. A lot of cynical people have gotten rich broadcasting and publishing red meat for movement conservative consumption.
So yes, it's the True Believers who have been blindsided, by ensconcing themselves in the echo chamber. But I don't find it implausible that a significant portion of Romney's campaign, just like a significant portion of the GOP itself, are themselves ensconced in the same echo chamber. 

I think the exchange where Megyn Kelly went backstage to ask the FOX number-cruncher dudes about "the math" was incredibly revealing. Those five minutes were like a one-act play entitled "Ladies and Gentlemen, Your 2012 GOP," with the following cast: first, Karl Rove, who could not and would not accept the Ohio call; next, Megyn Kelly, who dutifully pushed back against pesky facts at the behest of her puppet-masters; and finally, the analysts in the back room who were absolutely, totally confident in their numbers (and seemed faintly amused by the whole spectacle) and would not back down, despite all the thundering from King Lear Karl. 

So yeah, those data-guys DO exist on the Right, but they're not the ones in charge. They're not driving the decisions or strategy or Grand Narrative. And not only that; when they draw conclusions that contradict the Grand Narrative, the first response of the other players is to disregard or bully them into saying something else.

tl;dr: It's a big echo chamber.

Yeah, I don't think this is true.

A bit of column A, a bit of column B, I suspect. On the one hand, it definitely comes across as a no-one-could-have-foreseen-the-levees-would-fail ridiculousness.

On the other...

This is my second-favorite* Slacktivist blog entry, one that's stuck with me for two years, particularly this bit:
The point here is that we have a significant segment of the population that is no longer able to answer the question "What do you think/believe/feel/judge?" by saying what it is they really actually think or believe or feel or judge. Their response to any question is to calculate what that question means in terms of the zero-sum game and then to offer the answer they think will be strategically best for scoring points in that game.

This is a fundamentally disingenuous way of talking, voting and living and it's not possible to approach all those things disingenuously without that dishonesty and duplicity coming to shape, stunt and distort one's own thinking.

Constantly arguing in bad faith leads to thinking in bad faith and to living in bad faith, until bad faith is all you've got left. Calculation becomes habit, that habit supplants thought and one winds up in the perverse circumstance of earnestly arguing for the goodness of oil spills.
Oil spills were topical at the time of that writing for obvious reasons, but it's applicable to lots of other things.

*Favorite remains the bit on empathy and epistemic closure.

Obviously this was an actually intimate event in terms of the depth of mutual feeling in the room. But he summons enough mutuality in his best soaring rhetorical performances with big crowds that I think he could get away with doing this in other contexts. He's strong enough to be soft when he wants to, that's a hell of a quality for a leader. 

He's got some serious convincing to do in the coming few months. I think he should add a town hall tour to his schedule for December to explain what's at stake with sequestration looming. And just talk like this, never break into soaring tones.

In a final farewell gaffe, the Romney's campaign accidentally published their transition website for President-Elect Romney.

You know, if someone on the staff isn't preparing for both victory and defeat--websites, speeches, the whole shebang--that's a sign of a campaign that is completely incompetent. You know--the speechwriting people, the website people--that's what they do. I mean, even if there is only one percent chance, you make some preparations just in case, for every eventuality.

So having a transition web site all ready to go--just what you'd expect them to do.

But how in the BLAZES is someone incompetent enough to let it go live!? I don't even have words . . .

Two new things I've heard today:

Charlie Cook on CSPAN's Post-Election Analysis panel: People like Akin and Mourdock were saying things that you could never get away with in a normal conversation.

And Richard Wolffe this morning on MSNBC: There just wasn't enough hate to elect Romney.

I don't know if this is posted upstream

I found the report from back then and my comment about it. We were looking more at motives then, instead of the relationship between threat and action. That study was clearly foundational in that it resulted in the creation of today's approach to assassination threats. 

But here's what it says about threat vs. action:
"Many subjects had histories of harassing other persons"

"Most are known to have histories of aggressive, angry behavior, but only have are known to have had histories of violent behavior"

"The assumption of many writers has been that those who make threats, pose threats. While some threateners may pose threats, sometimes those who pose threats do not make threats....fewer than a tenth of the assassins, attackers, and near-lethal approachers communicated a direct threat to the target or a law enforcement agency. No assassin or attacker communicated a direct threat about their target to the target or to a law enforcement agency before their attack or near-lethal approach[sic]. [But] attackers and near-lethal approachers were not completely secretive about their aims and intentions. Almost two thirds of the subjects are known to have made some threat about their targets in the days, weeks, and months before their attack or near-lethal approach. Attackers and would-be attackers usually expressed their intentions, either by letting someone know or by writing letters, notes, or journals that described their thinking and state of mind. Some subjects told family members that they intended to attack the target; others mentioned their aims to co-workers or friends; still others kept detailed journals in which they recorded their hopes and plans."
The US Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center is a group created in response to the findings of the Exceptional Case Study. It provides research and analysis on assessing threats to Secret Service protectees, judges, schools, and others. 

It's a weird area of law enforcement/protection because
Traditional law enforcement activities aim at apprehending and prosecuting perpetrators of violence after the commission of their crimes. In most circumstances, the primary responsibility of law enforcement professionals is to determine whether a crime has been committed, conduct an investigation to identify and apprehend the perpetrator, and gather evidence to assist prosecutors in a criminal trial. However, when police officers are presented with information and concern about a possible future violent crime, their responsibilities, authority, and investigative tools and approaches are less clear. “Threat assessment” is the term used to describe the set of investigative and operational techniques that can be used by law enforcement professionals to identify, assess, and manage the risks of targeted violence and its potential perpetrators.
The National Threat Assessment Center has produced Protective Intelligence & Threat Assessment Investigations: A Guide for State and Local Law Enforcement Officials. This document repeats the finding that those who pose a threat often do not make threats. However, the vocabulary "threat" is used here to mean a direct communication of intent to assassinate to the target and/or law enforcement. They go on to say:
These data do not suggest that investigators should ignore threats that are communicated to or about public officials or figures. Many persons may have been prevented or deterred from taking action because of a prompt response to their threatening communications. However, careful attention should also be paid to identifying, investigating, and assessing anyone whose behaviors suggest that he or she might pose threats of violence, even if the individual does not communicate direct threats to a target or to the authorities.
They say also
Assassinations and attacks on public officials and figures are the products of understandable and often discernible processes of thinking and behavior.
and
thinking about assassination is compartmentalized; some potential assassins engage in ongoing internal discussions about attacks while maintaining outward appearances of normality. In every ECSP case, assassination was the result of an understandable and often identifiable process involving the attacker’s pattern of thoughts, decisions, behaviors, and actions that preceded the attack.
and
Who, then, is dangerous to public officials and figures? Generally, a person who thinks that attacking a public official or figure is a desirable, acceptable, or potentially effective way to achieve a goal can be considered a potential assassin. If such a person has or develops the capacity to mount an attack on a public official or figure, the threat increases."
The "acceptable" criterion there is uncomfortable. I don't think the woman in the video meets other categories for threat, but she does have this one qualifier: it wouldn't surprise her, it wouldn't bother her. It is "acceptable." 

So the idea of protection is built on the idea that you need to identify potential threats and mitigate them.
Some persons self-identify—they call, write, e-mail, or approach a public official or figure or indicate an unusual or inappropriate interest in a person. These individuals often give their names or provide other information that leads to easy identification. 

The threatener—someone who communicates a direct, indirect, or conditional threat—is the classic example of a self-identifier. Such a person may threaten for various reasons: to warn of a possible attack, to ask to be stopped, to demand help or attention, to express frustration or anger, or to communicate distress. Threats should always be investigated; even if a threat is not an early warning of attack, making a threat is usually a violation of law, which is a valid reason for opening an investigation.
There's some interesting reading after that about what you do after you have identified a threat. Basically, you mount an investigation, and you evaluate to see whether any of the other risk factors are present, such as
identification of the subject’s “attack-related” behaviors. Perpetrators of targeted acts of violence engage in discrete behaviors that precede and are linked to their attacks; they consider, plan, and prepare before engaging in violent actions.
and if so, develop a case management plan for that person. If not, you close the investigation but retain the file.

One of the things that leaps out from the documentation is that one of the biggest risk factors for assassination threat is "past stressful events." It seems that a great many people who undertake an assassination project are, in part, reacting to something bad that happened to them in the recent past. I understand that part of the abundance of threats against Obama is pure racism. But what concerns me about those threats is that we're living in a time in which "past stressful events" - a frequent example of which is job loss or financial struggle - are more and more common. 

Anyway, all things taken into account, yes, it does seem like they need to go talk to anyone who puts something like that in writing, even if they are a callous and racist simpleton. These documents could use an update, but if twenty years ago someone was writing stuff about assassination in "journals," "notes," and "letters," I suspect that today they may be writing them on Facebook, Twitter, and blogs.

So, it looks like turnout and policy weren't the only thing Romney's campaign team got wrong. The ominously named Project ORCA was being called Romney's secret weapon or the world's largest exit poll. Basically, through an app, it would collect data from Republican poll watchers throughout the country. This data would be fed into campaign HQ, where they would have near real time numbers to keep track of who voted. They would compare this list with registered voters, and use the data to find out where to push those last emails, calls, and other messages to potential voters. There was even a button to report voter fraud.

However on election day, ORCA was a fail whale:

"While I was home, I took to Twitter and the web to try to find some answers. From what I saw, these problems were widespread. People had been kicked from poll watching for having no certificate. Others never received their pdf packets. Some were sent the wrong packets from a different area. Some received their packet, but their usernames and passwords didn't work."*

"According to GOP sources on the ground, Romney camp's "ORCA" turnout app has crashed, so they can't monitor their turnout operation.—"

"Long story short: Don't beta-test an election." *

“Another 4 years of this (N-word),” Denise Helms wrote. “Maybe he will get assassinated this term.”

Is that a threat according to the standard being used? I suppose my underlying thought process is that it's basically impossible to find out if the correlation between being an assassin and making threats (which there appear to be) is mirrored by a correlation between making threats and being an assassin. You'd need to massively infringe on people's privacy and devote disproportionate resources in order to find this out. 

My instinct is that there is likely no correlation between using this kind of semi-threatening language and being an assassin, but I've no real way of finding out, I suspect.

So, what is the requirement for poll watching/monitoring in other states? 

Because in MN it's pretty limited and fairly strict. Poll watchers can only do so with proper credentials from their party, have to live within the precinct they are monitoring, have to keep out of the way, and can only challenge voters they personally know are ineligible to vote, and even then if the voter is willing to swear an other that they are eligible the voter can vote provisionally. Otherwise the poll watcher has no standing at the poll.

Oh and we don't allow any campaign signage, including tee shirts or buttons, to be visible at the poll.

An interesting point in one of today's Nate Silver posts:

He's projecting Obama will come up 2.5% up in the popular vote.

But for Romney to win, he would have had to win the popular vote by a full 3%.

So Romney was only 2.5% away from winning the popular vote--which, we all know, is meaningless.

But he was a full 5.5% (in popular vote terms) away from actually winning the election and that is a long, long way. That's why a guy like Silver was saying this wasn't really a close one.

It's not quite that big in reality, but it is pretty stunning. Romney didn't need "a full 3%" lead in the popular vote, he needed around 2.3% (2.5% to get back to a popular vote tie plus 2.3% = 4.8%, which would have given him Colorado, the tipping point state).

Also keep in mind that most votes he picked up would have been votes taken away from Obama, so he "only" to needed increase his own percentage by 2.4% and watch Obama's come down the same amount.

It's still a pretty crazy statistic that shows how well the Obama campaign played the actual game - winning 270 electoral votes - rather than the popular vote game. Another way that chart stood out to me: Romney won one state by under 8%, while Obama won ten. Obama was way more efficient at turning votes into electors.

My instinct is that there is likely no correlation between using this kind of semi-threatening language and being an assassin, but I've no real way of finding out, I suspect.

Well, there does seem to be a clear correlation in that 2/3 of assassins have put forward some sort of threatening language, and something like under 10%ish have made a clear direct threat. 

What that means is that of the very large set of people who use threatening language, some members of that set will also be in the set of assassins. 2/3 of the assassin set are also in the threatening language set. 

Given that there may be very few other ways to identify assassins, since direct threats are so rare, few, and so serious and focused that they come late in the game, it does seem to make sense to investigate the threatening-language set and evaluate them for the other factors that may indicate assassination ideation. 

And there's probably something to be said for the deterrent effect of investigating the threatening-language set, though I didn't see any data about that. However, even I know not to joke about bombs when I'm standing in the airport, even though I desperately want to and in that setting it seems like the funniest thing ever.

Project Orca

The Democrats like to think that their “ground game” is the tie-breaker that will give them the edge in a tight election, but this year there is reason to believe that the Democrats’ efforts will be equaled, if not exceeded, by those of the Romney campaign. The Romney campaign is not only well-funded, but is run by one of the best organizers and managers of his generation, the candidate himself. Whom would you count on to organize anything, Mitt Romney or David Axelrod?

This ORCA thing is kind of amazing. Reading about it now.

On the one hand, I'm like wow, smart idea. Really smart - coordinate party exit polling with precinct data, target your ground game to get out the last-minute vote. Really smart. This blog says it's an old practice called strike lists that used to be done analog, but obviously would be a lot better ddone digitally.

But it seems like the execution totally failed. And that's what distinguishes it from the OBama team. When I volunteered with them in 2008 (shamefully I did nothing this time) I was consistently awed at how thorough, focused, detail-oriented and good the organization was. The tools were sharp, the data was up to date, the management was observant. They really cared about efficacy and metrics, they weren't just "rah rah." 

That's the difference between the Obama team and this: "At 5:00 when the exit polls come out, I doubt we'll pay attention to it, because we will have had much more scientific information just based on the political, uh, operation we have set up...the Obama campaign likes to brag about their ground operation, but it's nothing compared to this." Also, "People think it's an acronym, but it's not. Narwhal is what the President's - what his operation is called - so orca is the only known predator to that." 

So...the reason people think it's an acronym is probably that you capitalize all its letters, but we can let that slide. 

Then, stuff like this:
On one of the last conference calls (I believe it was on Saturday night), they told us that our packets would be arriving shortly. Now, there seemed to be a fair amount of confusion about what they meant by "packet". Some people on Twitter were wondering if that meant a packet in the mail or a pdf or what. Finally, my packet arrived at 4PM on Monday afternoon as an emailed 60 page pdf. Nothing came in the mail. Because I was out most of the day, I only got around to seeing it at around 10PM Monday night. So, I sat down and cursed as I would have to print out 60+ pages of instructions and voter rolls on my home printer. Naturally, for reasons I can't begin to comprehend, my printer would not print in black and white with an empty magenta cartridge (No HP, I will never buy another one of your products ever again). So, at this point I became panicked. I was expected to be at the polls at 6:45AM and nothing was open. I was thankfully able to find a Kinko's open until 11PM that was able to print it out and bind it for me, but this is not something I should have had to do. They expected 75-80 year old veteran volunteers to print out 60+ pages on their home computers? The night before election day? From what I hear, other people had similar experiences. In fact, many volunteers never received their packets at all.
More hilarity ensues in that link. 

It's pretty interesting that to a very large degree, campaigning - and winning - has become a data war, a war of designing platforms and integrating information. May the best wonks win.

Oh yes, I'm not making a "this policy isn't a good thing" criticism. If one chooses to say threatening things one has to deal with the fact that the threatening statement may be taken seriously. 

The question in my mind is really how measurable the effect of the policy is. The effect of having failed to do it in any particular case is, of course, huge. However, given the complexity of human behaviour and the size of the threatening-language set I think there's an interesting question as to whether that set would perform better than control in producing assassins. Would there be a statistically significant difference between members of the threatening-language set selected for investigation and members of the general population? Maybe? What about a control set of people with identifiably radical political views? Maybe not? Going down this line of thought I can see how security services develop methodologies that may seem iniquitous and invasive to the ordinary population, but wholly justifiable to those implementing them. Which isn't an argument against security services, just for robust checks on their power.

What the documents say is that they do devote those resources, and that it's worth it because the consequences are so great, and the targets so known and so few.

Oh, sorry, I was talking specifically about the resources to do research, and that I don't think you'd ever get it past an ethics committee anyway.

I'm no mathematician but isn't there some conclusion you can reason to from the fact that just 1/3 of the actual assassins and attempted assassins never made any threats, but 2/3 did? 

I guess the trick is that people who make 0 threats but go on to become an assassin are still in the set of people who make 0 threats, which has to be insanely huge. Meanwhile people who make 1 or more threats are probably a much smaller proportion of the population. It seems like there's something here to work with, but like I said, I'm no statistician.

Wow, that Charles P. Pierce article that homunculus linked to brought me to Todd Gitlin, who used to run the Mass Comm liberal arts program at Cal (my major and alma mater, respectively). His suggested charter for the Occupy Movement is inspiring and dead-on: 

1. Drive big money out of politics. Elections should be publicly financed. The Citizens United decision needs to be rescinded, for corporations are not persons and the ability of some people to spend millions encourages politicians to bend to the wealthiest. But more: television time for candidates ought to be free, like the licenses that permit broadcasters to broadcast on the public airwaves.
2.	Make taxation more progressive. For example, tax capital gains and dividends at the same rate as wages and salaries.
3.	Tax financial market transactions. There is already a Robin Hood Tax campaign, led by National Nurses United, and a House bill to support it, HR 6411. Eleven European countries and the European Commission have adopted a version of this proposal.

Miko, you're probably looking for Bayes' theorem. 

What is the probability that someone is an assassin, given that they have verbally threatened the President?

I'll use A to represent assassins and T to represent people who verbally threatened the President. 
P(A) means "the probability that someone is an assassin"; 
P(T) means "the probability that someone verbally threatened the President"; 
P(A|T) means "the probability that someone is an assassin, given that he or she threatened the President"; 
P(T|A) means "the probability that someone threatened the President, given that he or she is an assassin.

Let's assume that there are, say, twelve assassins in the USA, which implies that the odds of a random person being an assassin are one around in twenty-five million. 
We believe that two thirds of assassins will verbally threaten the President. 
And let's say that there are a million people in the USA who have verbally threatened the President, which means the odds of a random person verbally threatening the President are around one in three hundred.

So, we know: 
P(T) = 1/300
P(A) = 1/25,000,000
P(T|A) is 2/3

We want to find out P(A|T)
Bayes' theorem says:

P(A|T) = (P(T|A) * P(A)) / P(T) 
substituting
P(A|T) = (2/3 * 1/25,000,000) / (1/300)
P(A|T) = 2/75,000,000 * 300
P(A|T) = 600/75,000,000
P(A|T) = 1/125,000

So given my assumptions it's not very likely that someone verbally threatening the President is an assassin, but (a) it has narrowed the possibilities right down from something huge (one in twenty-five million people to scrutinise) to something just manageable; (b) there is a rational basis for suspicion, which justifies an investigation; (c) my assumptions were pulled out of my rosy tuchus and the Secret Service undoubtedly have a better idea of what things warrant investigation.

> It's pretty interesting that to a very large degree, campaigning - and winning - has become a data war, a war of designing platforms and integrating information. May the best wonks win.

Reading more about ORCA, it shows that it was definitely the result of someone blowing smoke about how amazing software could do things, but not realizing the scale of the logistics involved in it. It is the ultimate outsource project: instead of relying on lots of local and regional organizers and spending hours working and cultivating community, just make an app and people will flock to it, like naturally and stuff.

I wouldn't be surprised if the obama campaign / DNC is working on a similar system, but since they aren't trying to build the entire system overnight (it sounds like they already have a lot of this data collection tools and software already), just extend extra ways to input and retrieve data out one more layer to actual field folks, it would be a more successful program.

I imagine someone walked into Romney's campaign and promised for a few million dollars, they could deliver a ground game comparable to Obama's without having to employ as many people.

And this really starts to explain how they were taken by such surprise about everything else: they were so out of their league they didn't even realize how that would be impossible to do with just software (I mean, republicans haven't been champions of community organization), and their software was bad. I bet they were seeing great numbers on their big shiny "single pane of glass" visual displays in the campaign headquarters, but no one realized that their data was wrong.

Upthread some folks were asking what filibuster reform in the Senate might look like.

It looks like Senator Jeff Merkley (OR) is leading the charge. Here is his proposal:
#1) Narrow the Scope:
Eliminate the use of the filibuster on motions to proceed. Blocking deliberation has little place in a legislative body. If a Senator believes a bill is so deeply flawed that debate should be suspended, the senator still has the right to move to table the bill.

#2) Further Narrow the Scope:
We should consider further narrowing the scope. For example, it is worth debating banning filibusters on amendments since members would still have the right to filibuster the final vote. It is also worth examining the value of limiting filibusters on appointing conferees.

#3) Create an Expedited Path for Nominations:
The Senate is failing in its responsibility to “advise and consent” on nominations, doing extensive damage to the other branches of government. This is an abuse of its responsibility. 

We should consider, therefore, an expedited regular order for nominations. The regular order for each nominee might still be subject to a filibuster, but only under the revised filibuster requirements discussed below.

#4) Require a filibuster petition:
Require a substantial number of senators, perhaps 10, to file a filibuster petition to block a simple majority vote on an amendment or a bill. By creating a public record, senators have to take responsibility for obstructing the process. This also prevents a single senator from blocking the regular order.

#5) Require filibustering senators to hold the floor:
The public believes that filibustering senators have to hold the floor. Indeed, the public perceives the filibuster as an act of principled public courage and sacrifice. Let’s make it so. 

Require a specific number of Senators -- I suggest five for the first 24 hours, 10for the second 24 hours, and 20 thereafter -- to be on the floor to sustain the filibuster. This would be required even during quorum calls. At any point, a member could call for a count of the senators on the floor who stand in opposition to the regular order, and if the count falls below the required level, the regular order prevails and a majority vote is held

From yesterday's WaPo:

Some top donors privately unloaded on Romney’s senior staff, describing it as a junior varsity operation that failed to adequately insulate and defend Romney through a summer of relentless attacks from the Obama campaign over his business career and personal wealth.

“Everybody feels like they were a bunch of well-meaning folks who were, to use a phrase that Governor Romney coined to describe his opponent, way in over their heads,” said one member of the campaign’s national finance committee, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.

“Romney World,” the fundraiser added, “will fade into the obscurity of a lot of losing campaigns.”

...

A second member of Romney’s national finance committee said that while the campaign’s tactics and fundraising organization were executed well, the strategy and message were “total failures.” This fundraiser added that the campaign’s cautious and adversarial relationship with the news media proved detrimental.

In the middle of the piece, there's a lot of yammering about Chris Christie.

As I think about it more, ORCA sounds like something one of my former employers would have thought of during one of his coke binges. Create or promise some solution, that works on a small scale, but is so cobbled together by people who just barely knew enough to make things work, that it had to be continually finessed and maintained. More importantly to him, it meant that maintaining it would mean continual revenue, so the fact he had underbid the original project and not allocated the write staff or hours to work on it wasn't a problem, since any additional work the customer would continue to pay most of the time, since he'd just keep convincing them it was going to work, and keep lying through hist teeth and convince his deluded, coke addled brain that the problems were the customers fault.

If you're interested, a page at The Guardian has the results to download, and there's a Google Spreadsheet embedded there that you can use for questions like this.

I think all of these are useful points.

It of course depends on how many people you're checking and what the cost of doing so is. (b) in some ways seems odd, because I can see where you're coming from, there is a rational basis for suspicion of everyone, and there is probably a rational basis for suspicion of certain groups that we do not wish to see discrimination against (those with radical views, for example). I think part of the argument that goes unspoken here is about a level of culpability on the part of the person making the statement.

Thanks for pointing this out. If this is what the new rules look like, I for one am all in favor. I've long thought the filibuster does serve some good purpose, but have seen it abused mightily this past few years. Reducing its scope but still keeping it around in a more difficult to use form is exactly the sort of compromise I'd hoped for. Let's hope the Democrats get serious and change the rules come January.

Obstructionism, which I don't have a problem with when it's used judiciously. However, when every bill is a mortal affront and is thus filibustered, it goes too far. I think bringing back the requirement that the floor actually be held is great, because like any powerful, but possibly abusive, tool its user should pay a high price.

I prefer my government operate on consensus as much as possible. Obstructing the majority should not be easy, but I think the mechanism's existence is important to protect the minority. That the present Republican party is devoid of anything approaching scruples makes it easy to say the filibuster should be cast aside, but I think that's taking a short view.

I see where you're coming from, and I would certainly be on board with all of Merkley's reforms as an incremental step, but for reasons outlined in this post, I think keeping the filibuster around, even in a neutered form, is a bad idea. If anyone could point to one major progressive goal that was achieved using the filibuster, then maybe I could be on board, but as it is, it's just another tool for the maximalist Republicans to use against the Charlie-Brown-who's-convinced-he's-finally-going-to-kick-the-football Democrats.

Lemieux's point about how the Senate's malapportionment naturally skews the effect of the filibuster toward protecting conservatives is particularly compelling to me. The Senate is already a body in which Wyoming's two Republican senators representing 0.2% of the population have as much voting power as California's two Democratic senators representing 12% of the population. If anything, I could maybe be on board with use of the filibuster in the House, but the supermajority requirement in the malapportioned upper chamber makes no sense whatsoever.

Possibly.

It's real crucial a site of this importance go live when it's supposed to go live, or there's hell to pay on the business end. 

TL;DR: The Romney president-elect transition site was under contract to go live 100%, perfect and running on a certain secured and dedicated server, on a certain due date, regardless of the outcome.

MR. EPSTEIN: I do, Your Honor.

THE COURT: If you honestly believe that, show it to me, because you were -- in another context, and in this case, you have argued that it's literally not there. You have argued that the absence of the language means the absence of the law. Now you're telling me to look at this and find an obligation, a burden, if you will, within the penumbras of this statute. Show it to me. All I'm asking is to see it. If I can see it, I can believe it. But if you can't show it to me, then make your penumbras argument. We're going to be transparent, and you're going to tell me -- if you expect to prevail, somebody is going to answer my question because no one is answering it from your side as to where it is.
So tell me if it's in the penumbras because you can't point to the language. So show me where it is. Show me where it's meant. Show me the legislative history. Show me the facts that the secretary used to make the decision to change this directive at seven o'clock on a Friday night on the eve of an election. I want to see it, and I want to see it now. Show it to me.

MR. EPSTEIN: Your Honor, I have no legislative history to present to the Court.

Look, I don't have a dog in this fight (except insofar as I have relatives in the USA) and I don't feel vindictive, but if we want to have more than one serious political party in the USA the Republicans really need to wake up to the fact that they failed calamitously and that their failures were ludicrous.

We encountered a little voter suppression in PA. My bro-in-law was voting for the first time in PA, and that requires an ID requirement separate from the new photo ID law (that has been mostly struck down, requiring no photo ID). He had to show one of a few various IDs, there is not a photo requirement. He showed his voter registration card.

The (we assume) Republican poll watcher pitched a shit fit over this. My sister had to go outside and bring in the posted flyer that listed the requirements before they would let him vote. After they were gone (I was a bit behind them in line) he was still trying to argue the vote should be stricken. (Can you even do that after it is locked in?) but the poll workers repeated, "She showed us the flyer, he doesn't need photo ID!"

It was somewhat chilling to see the supression attempts in action, my sister is a lawyer and if she wasn't forcefully arguing for him I don't know if he would have been able to get his vote counted.

My last comment tonight before I konk out. POLITICO spills more beans on Project ORCA:

"Among other issues, the system was never beta-tested or checked for functionality without going live before Election Day, two sources said. It went live that morning but was never checked for bugs or efficiencies internally."

"It's been reported the system crashed at 4 p.m., but multiple sources familiar with the war room operation said it had actually been crashing throughout the day."

Here, they say that perhaps Project ORCA failed because it was based on old "HTTP Web Architectures" as opposed to something used to real-time like HTML5. Anyone app developers here that can comment on this would be welcome. Especially if you've worked on the Romney Apps.

I'm amazed at the amount of fail for this. I know in the other post they were saying how Democrats shouldn't feel so good about their tech and organization, since the Republicans felt the same way with Rove during the Bush years. And, I might agree, though for a different reason. It's not that Obama is THAT good. It's just that Romney is so bad by comparison.

I have not worked on the Romney apps, but:

a) you will note that all HTML5 web addresses start with http://. Almost like HTML5 is itself generally sitting on top of the net (as in this case).
b) regardless of if HTML5 might have improved responsiveness very slightly over plain HTML static pages, the dev team should each write "I am an idiot who did not buy enough server capacity although I knew the amount of users, the amount of data required, and controlled the release date" a hundred times.
c) Amazon Web Services. This allows people to rent computation and web serving capacity; this type of temporary burst of usage is one of the core use cases.

It would be irresponsible to not at least check.

You figure they've long since got it down to a routine science

It would be incredibly bad PR if someone said something like this, wasn't investigated and then attempted an assassination, but that's not the same thing as this being a good use of the resources devoted to protecting the US president.... Is a person who has indicated that they'd like someone to be assassinated measurably more likely to be part of a plot than someone who has indicated that they hate him, his race and his policies? I'd actually be interested to know the answer to that.

Well, first of all, most recent assassins and wannabes -- at least the ones that got close enough to get a shot off -- haven't been part of any discernible plot at all.

But the resources here are Secret Service. What they do when the President is not in town needing protection is investigate counterfeiting (you know, their other job -- which turns out to be a good resource match despite not having been planned that way). So you're essentially diverting resources away from making sure the guy with a color printer isn't running off a bunch of twenties.

As to the first point, I don't think you can really get a gut check about someone by looking at Facebook, but I bet you could if you spoke to them for five minutes. Better those not pan out 99 times out of 100 than not. (And consider how much experience those other 99 interviews give you for the one that matters.) Hinckley, after all, managed to stalk TWO Presidents for months before getting a good firing position.

I do still wonder what the hell the Romney campaign was doing dropping money on ad buys in Pennsylvania in the final weeks, though.

See, money talks and bullshit (aka most punditry) walks. So there must have been some belief that it was worth spending money there for this to happen. The only question is whether they were doing it because they really thought they could flip it, or whether they were bluffing and trying to get the Democrats to spend resources (not just ads, but perhaps Obama visits, etc.) there. Because that sort of thing does happen. The other reason it might have happened would be to project confidence and help down-ticket races -- though in this case it looks like the only tippable race was Rothfus v. Critz.

You know ... there’s some evidence to suggest that maybe they genuinely could have been caught completely flat-footed by losing. There were several very visible moments in the campaign when it became clear that Romney and Ryan were not only repeating the untrue talking points of the right-wing echo chamber, but that they ACTUALLY BELIEVED THEM.

The most memorable was during the debate when Romney said it took Obama two weeks to call the attack on the Consulate an “act of terror”. He was sure of it, even argued about it while Obama was telling him to “check the transcript”. And there were others. Even the 47 percent comment was based on another inaccurate right-wing talking point.

They really were demonstrably listening to the right-wing pundits and closing their ears to other voices. And before the election, all the right-wing pundits – all of them – were saying that Romney was going to win.

The Romney campaign might very well be an example of one of the dangers of constantly spewing out false propaganda. At some point, it stops becoming entirely something that people at the top use to control the people at the bottom. At some point, the people at the top start to believe it as well.

I’m reminded of one of the key points of "1984". Those in charge didn’t just eliminate or co-opt those who might rebel against the system. They eliminated those who understood the system too well. So that eventually there would be no one left who even knew that they were lying.

Here's a take on ORCA from a disappointed user. It's pretty stunning how badly this went. At the same time, this is just another form of poll denialism, an "if only, if only" to distract from the fact that they lost because they're terrible.

Wow. So on election this very dedicated Romney volunteer spent six hours trying to get his poll watcher certificate that the campaign had forgotten to notify their volunteers they would need- six hours! on election day!
So, I headed back home to see if I could get my certificate. I called their official help line. It went unanswered. I tried their legal line. Same thing. I emailed them. No response. I continued to do this for six straight hours and never got a response. I even tried to call three local victory centers. All went straight to voicemail.

While I was home, I took to Twitter and the web to try to find some answers. From what I saw, these problems were widespread. People had been kicked from poll watching for having no certificate. Others never received their pdf packets. Some were sent the wrong packets from a different area. Some received their packet, but their usernames and passwords didn't work.
It sounds like ORCA was not their only problem. 

I used to smile every time I passed the group of election signs at the major intersection on my way to the gym. In amidst all the "Vote for" signs was one asking for Romney Campaign Volunteers. That sign went up about 4 days before the election. I always smiled to myself because it seemed a little desperate, after all the Obama volunteer force had been in place for months and they recruited by word of mouth and emails, not street signs. As it turned out Obama lost NC-- but his loss was not due to a poor ground game, the votes just were not there.

But I wonder about the future of volunteerism. Will the Republicans ever have ground support as enthusiastic (and young) as the Obama campaign? Will the Democrats?

OK, sorry... I went to bed before answering the "most liberal county in MN" bit:

Kind of a trick answer in sorts, there are 4 counties in the running, Cook, Hennipen, St. Louis, Ramsey: One (Cook) very Rural, 2 (Hennipen/Ramsey) very Urban, and 1 (St Louis) a strong mix between urban and rural)

I looked at 4 factors, Marriage equality, Voter ID law, % vote for president, and 

Cook County is a SMALL populated county in the very NE section of the state, abutting Canada, % wise it had the highest numbers against Voter ID, 64%, Ramsey 62%, St Louis 62%, Hennipen 60%

In Voting for President Ramsey and St Louis where close 67% and 64% (Cook takes 4th with 60%)

Marriage Equality: Hennepin 63% Ramsey at 61% Cook at 59% St Louis 55%

Out of the top 4, only St Louis has an estimate 0% of ballots let blank on the Amendment issues, 

MN once again led the nation in voter turnout %, with about 76% of eligible voters. 95% turn out in St Louis Co, 95% in Cook, 99.7 in Hennipen and 99.8 in Ramsey.

That badass Ohio judge is named Algernon Marbley.

Actually, it's Algenon (no "r".) Wikipedia.

A full transcript of the hearing is available on Scribd here. It's good stuff.

At one point Judge Marbley actually takes some pity on the state's lawyer and asks him if he had any involvement in writing the directive. When the answer is "No", the judge calls a recess so the court can attempt to track down who actually wrote it and put 'em in front of the judge to explain what the hell they were thinking.

When the answer comes back as, basically, "The directive was written by staff in committee," this exchange takes place - 

THE COURT: Mr. Epstein -- by the way, just to confirm, you weren't in this chain?
MR. EPSTEIN: That's correct.
THE COURT: They just sent you down here to argue it but they didn't ask you to help create it.

Ohio’s GOP Secretary of State Already Has A Plan To Rig The 2016 Election For Republicans
Husted’s solution to this perceived problem of Democrats and the national media picking on him? He says we should make Ohio less important in the election by dividing up our electoral votes by Congressional district.

This is huge and should raise giant red flags. Under the current winner-take-all system, Obama won all 18 of Ohio’s electoral votes. Under Husted’s plan, 12 of those 18 electoral votes would be handed to Mitt Romney, the popular vote loser.

The vote by county/district option comes up every few years for swing states. It's always the party that loses the electoral votes and it always gets shot down because it's a horrible idea for the state.

I can recall it's been floated here in PA by the republicans and in CO by the democrats back before the 2004 election. It never gains traction because it takes your state out of the game.

Ohio goes from being a net +18 in the path to 270 EV's to a net +3-6 for the candidate of either party who wins. Ohio goes from being the central focus of the campaigns to the equivalent of Idaho or Mississippi.

I'm pretty sure two different types of turnout figures are being used in this sentence. The statewide figure is an estimate of the percentage of persons eligible to vote who voted and the county-wide figures are the percentages of registered voters who voted. Minnesota has relatively easy same-day registration, so in big elections we can have lots of people registering at the polling place. Given that very low barrier to entry, I find the percentage of eligible voters who vote a much more interesting figure.

See, money talks and bullshit (aka most punditry) walks. So there must have been some belief that it [Pennsylvania] was worth spending money there for this to happen. The only question is whether they were doing it because they really thought they could flip it,

One of the postmortems I read said that the Romney campaign had internal polling following a very similar scheme to the unskewed polls guy. So it was skewed like +3 or +5 or +7 or whatever towards Republicans and under that scheme Pennsylvania looked like it was on the cusp of winnable and just needed that little extra boost.

In short--yes, they were drinking their own kool-aid.

Triple funny for me because one of the first Facebook messages I saw after the election results were announced was from a Mormon friend about how we all need to just stay calm, take a deep breath, and make sure our two year supplies* are topped up.

The two year supply of food & staples Mormons spend a lot of time talking about--disaster preparedness, see. The guy in the cartoon has packed his two-year supply and his 20 kids in the car, with the dog crate conveniently tied on top of it all. See, Romney is having a positive effect on Mormon culture!

Yeah, there's gloating going on. But, from my Canadian perspective, I'm also getting a profound level of seven-year-olds-having-a-tantrum sore loser-ishness. 

And again (because it's been haunting my dreams), look no further than Greg Nog's link from a while back:

If I meet a Democrat in my life from here on out, I will shun them immediately. I will spit on the ground in front of them, being careful not to spit in their general direction so that they can't charge me with some stupid little nuisance law. Then I'll tell them in no un-certain terms: "I do not associate with Democrats. You all are communist pigs, and I have nothing but utter disgust for you. Sir/Madam, you are scum of the earth." Then I'll turn and walk the other way.

Buttons. Boy, you can have a lot of fun with this. I plan to make up a bunch of buttons, and wear them around town, sayings like "Democrats are Communist Pigs," or "Welfare moochers steal from hard-working Americans," "Only Nazis support Seat Belt laws" or "No Smoking Ban: Nanny-Staters go Fuck Yourselves." 

As I said before. We do need a new word for this moment when satire and reality become indistinguishable. Earlier, I suggested SinguHilarity. But over drinks last night, I was convinced that that's one syllable too many. So now it's just SingHilarity. Though if you've had a few drinks, you can just slur it any way you like.

Re investigating threats against the president:

TURLOCK -- A Turlock woman who posted inflammatory comments on Facebook about President Barack Obama has been fired from her job and reported to the U.S. Secret Service.

Turlock resident Denise Helms, 22, posted shortly after the president's re-election Tuesday on her Facebook page, "And another 4 years of the (n-----). Maybe he will get assassinated this term..!!"

...

Helms has since deleted the post and posted again about the incident. It reads: "So apparently my post last night about Obama got onto Twitter and Fox 40 came and interviewed me cause apparently a lot of people in Sacramento think I'm crazy and racist. WOW is all I got to say!! I'm not racist and I'm not crazy. just simply stating my opinion.!!!"

(Er, you called him the N word. Hello? Maybe you're not racist, but you're acting like one.)

[Secret Service Agent] Gillingham said his office would be assigned to review any report from Turlock, but he would not comment further on any possible investigation into her posting.

"We get a lot of these kinds of referrals, especially off of the Internet," he said.

That day will come, but if you assume that both parties will hold the Senate about an equal amount of time (which they generally have) then the presence of the filibuster leads to worse outcomes long-term for progressives. Democrats are also far more circumspect in their use of the filibuster, generally in line with norms going back many decades, whereas the GOP uses it to turn the Senate into a body that requires a supermajority to name a post office.

The tweets I've seen where conservatives are making noises about moving to Oz get all defensive when it's pointed out that Oz has everything the conservatives claim to hate: No First Amendment; extremely strict gun control; and universal health care. Not just universal, but single-payer universal health care! 

I wonder how some people even manage to put their shoes on the correct feet.

In all seriousness, I do think that having Reid and Pelosi cut out of the negotiations (at least that's how it looks) is a bad precedent. It shows that if you're willing to strap yourself to a bomb and take down the President's agenda, you get rewarded by... getting a whole lot of his time and attention. I'm sure Harry and Nancy are more involved in back-channel negotiations than we're aware of, but having them be the only way they get to communicate with the President would show that they're negotiating with Barbara Lee's position as the left flank, not Obama's.

What was America scouting for? Ocean debris?

Patrol boats, most likely (see previously).

That's not right. We have compulsory voting in Australia and our turnout in 2004 was 94.32%. There's no way you can have 99.8% turnout in a county.

This type of figure (at least in the US) is measured against registered voters. If you have a surge in registrations, there's no reason you can't have 110% or more turnout (here in Wisconsin, we have same-day registration, so that can indeed happen). This, of course, is often misinterpreted by the right as proof of vote fraud, but it's just the way that the measurement works.

Australia also has an atheist prime minister, the aforementioned compulsory voting, no death penalty, and gives its citizens abortion access (no waiting, no consent needed of spouse/partner, and only one state requires parental consent, PLUS the mother's life generally takes precedence over the welfare of the fetus), etc.

But TP conservatives should totally move to Australia. I'm sure they'd be very happy there. We'd certainly be happier with 'em there, at any rate.

Obama was on the teevee today talking about the fiscal cliff slope negotiations, and he already seems to be conceding extension of the "middle class tax cut" -- i.e. only allowing the cuts for the top 2% to expire. This is a strategic error. Yes, the bad press coming from "Obama to allow tax cuts on 98% of the population to expire on December 31" will be brutal, but on Jan 1, he suddenly has a much better negotiating position, and can pin the failure to pass a middle class tax cut on the Republicans. Yes, this is high stakes poker, but conceding anything before negotiations has begun is not what people voted for on Tuesday.

I wonder what Mitt Romney is doing right now.
No one will refer to him by his code name, Javelin.

For six years, Mitt Romney pursued a singular goal, fervently seeking to fulfill a dream his father, too, once held: winning the presidency.

On Wednesday, for perhaps the first time since 2006 when he sat down with his longtime advisers to sketch out his first presidential run, he had to face the reality that it wasn’t meant to be.

His Secret Service protection is now gone, and there is no longer use for the code name he chose after a car once made by his father’s company. There is no more campaign plane, no daily schedules to follow, no battery of aides making sure he has the peanut butter and honey to make his beloved sandwich.

Instead, some Republicans speculate he’ll return to being an outcast in his own party and could relocate to the West Coast to start anew without the harsh glare of the national political spotlight.

By the end of his campaign, Romney seemed to have a sense of peace about the type of race he had run. But the man who loves data also has to accept that he was rejected by young voters, by minorities of every kind, and even by his hometown of Belmont and his home state of Massachusetts.

By the time he addressed his supporters on Tuesday night — in a massive convention hall that opened when he was governor, in the same building where he staged the national call day for his first campaign — the crowd had thinned. They chanted “Mitt! Mitt! Mitt!” and attempted to sing “God Bless America.” But it was lackluster and half-hearted. Some donors, who were vital to making sure his campaign was flush with cash, had left the convention hall when the result had become clear.

The country had moved on, and not in the direction they had hoped.

... It is unclear what Romney, 65, will do next, but those close to him expect it could be nonprofit work, becoming more active in the Mormon Church, or, for the time being, becoming a full-time grandfather.

But even his supporters don’t anticipate any political future. The post-campaign blame is already being targeted on some of Romney’s longtime Boston-based aides, which could alienate him from the Washington power brokers who never fully embraced him.

“I think he just fades,” said one top donor who has been close to Romney for years and spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I don’t see him doing anything in Washington. Maybe some advisory stuff, speeches now and then. But I think we’ve seen, for the most part, the last of Mitt Romney.”

... One supporter Wednesday said that the Romneys would likely move to La Jolla, Calif. They had been trying to renovate their home but put it on hold during the intensity of the race.*
Buh-bye.

"There's nothing that the Obama data team, there's nothing that the Obama campaign, there's nothing that President Obama himself can do to even come close to what we are putting together here," Romney Deputy Political Director Dan Centinello said Wednesday night in a training call for Project ORCA volunteers.

What's baffling me about this is, as far as I can tell they're just talking about a mobile website to let poll watchers input strike lists. Is that really it? It seems hard to believe that any campaign with time and money wouldn't have that -- it's the first thing you'd think of when you got around to "how shall we gather the information from our poll watchers?" I know Elizabeth Warren had one, and it's explicitly allowed for in the Massachusetts Secretary of State's rules on election monitoring. Not exactly cutting edge top secret stuff.

Therefore, everything he does is automatically awesome and he doesn't need to actually do anything to assure success, like hire the best people, monitor progress, inspire the troops, or instill a sense of mission and duty.

I went looking for some detail on the "fiscal cliff" cuts, found this general overview. I'm with Krugman. It seems almost too good to be true - you would never get the Repubs to agree to 50/50 defense vs. nondefense cuts, and once all those Bush tax cuts are gone the Dems and Obama can be the good guys - "we want tax cuts for the 99%, and these guys are blocking it".

Mandates aren’t quite “myths”, as political scientist Robert Dahl argued in a 1990 article, but neither are they readily identifiable entities about which we can make confident assertions. Arguing whether Mr Obama has a mandate is like debating whether somebody has mojo, or whether basketball star LeBron James is "in the zone" on a given night: there’s a discussion to be had, but no way to come to a definite conclusion.

Wittgenstein is helpful here. Consider proposition no. 114 in his "Philosophical Investigations": “One thinks that one is tracing the outline of a thing’s nature over and over again, and one is merely tracing round the frame through which we look at it.” So in claiming that President Obama “has” a mandate or “lacks” one, we are just giving voice to our conception of what a mandate is and whether we’d like to confer one on a given president. The mandate is in the eye of the beholder.

Presidents have mandates, then, if we perceive them as having mandates, and don’t if we don’t. Which means that President Obama has one and doesn’t have one. And nailing down the matter is even more problematic than that. When we perceive a president as having a mandate, we are making a claim about what the American people meant when they cast their votes. To be a little too obvious: there is no “mandate” box to check on electoral ballots. You just vote for a candidate. There is no formal or informal way for the people to “give” a president a mandate. So when journalists and politicians weigh in on the subject they are really psychoanalysing the electorate writ large. That’s no mean task.
A matter of perception.

Yep. This is because the pundit class and Republicans treat the Republicans and Democrats the same way supposedly neutral sports commentators treat large market teams and small market teams, respectively.

For example, when the Lakers are playing a smaller market team -- even a well-known smaller market team that contends for titles -- every Laker rally, dunk, and 3 point shot is HUGE and announced in great excitement, while there is markedly less enthusiasm for the smaller market team's accomplishment. 

Similarly, every Republican victory is absolute and sends a clear message to the Democrats; every Democrat victory is only by the slimmest of margins and certainly no reason for the Democrats to move forward confidently, as they're still on very shaky ground. This holds true no matter the margins.

It'd be hilarious if it didn't have such serious consequences for the way the country is governed.

TPM: After 2004, there was a lot of talk about a permanent Republican majority that turned out to be premature. How durable do you think the Democrats’ gains are this time around? 

TEIXEIRA: I think that it can be fairly durable. I think the word “permanent” is not appropriate since there are no permanent majorities in American politics even if the Democrats are able to do quite well with these emerging constituencies like Hispanics and Asians for awhile. Obviously, blacks are the group you’d least expect to defect, but certainly the rest of the growing minority population is in their corner and even more than they were just a few years ago. Democrats are doing well with college eduated women, they have professionals on their side, and of course the Millennial generation continues to vote pretty heavily Democratic.

But it’s all very dependent on how Republicans respond to this. If that party moves back towards the center in some meaningful way over time — which they show some signs of doing now — if the electoral vote stays against them long enough, eventually the forces in the party that see it as a problem will prevail. But that could take years. I think permanence isnt the issue so much as how long is a long time. Five years? Eight years? 20 years? I certainly think for this decade it looks like Democrats could have a continuing advantage because it’s likely to take the GOP awhile to right itself in the sense of getting more sensible on politics. And even when they develop the desire to do so, it takes time to implement it credibly and thus win constituents over. That sounds more like an eight-year project than a two- year one, but that’s just a guess.

Also, as the GOP looks for an answer, the same changes that have disadvantaged them over time are going to continue. It’s a moving target, a problem that is growing larger not smaller. For all these reasons I suspect the Democrats, while they will not win every election in the next 10 years, will have some sort of significant advantage from demographic shifts.

Mandate? To this day, I still wouldn't even call his presidency legitimate. 

One of the challenges Democrats faced though in those days were that the MSM were nearly openly supporting Republicans and biased towards Democrats, especially liberal-centrist ones (as opposed to Blue-dog Democrats). Democratic leaders at the time like Gephardt and Daschle did refuse to accept Bush's legitimacy at first, but unfortunately they eventually caved in.

I don't know, are Millennial college students really that naive? I actually find the club's backpedalling disingenuous given Ann Coulter's notoriety/prominence as a rightwing demagogue, and I'm quite surprised that they withdrew the invitation. 

About a decade ago, the (teeny) Republican Club at my New England all-women's college caused a furore when they invited Ann Coulter to speak at our campus. I almost suspected them of trolling but in the end, free speech won out and the event actually attracted a large crowd. Many student activists showed up to boo and protest, but there were also self-identified liberals who decided to just hear her out. The event failed to change anybody's minds about Ann Coulter, but all in all, it was a very good exercise in tolerance that jolted a bunch of sheltered, privileged students from their bubble.

The end of honestcoyote's link:
The result of all of these false numbers and inaccurate ground reports is simple: Mitt Romney had no idea what was coming on election day and his false sense of confidence directly translated into how the campaign operated in the closing weeks. In the words of one source, it was a con job. As David Mamet famously said, “If you’re in the con game and you don’t know who the mark is … you’re the mark.” Mitt Romney had no idea what was coming.
The "you don't know who the mark is" thing doesn't quite work; I doubt Romney had any idea he was in a con,whereas most poker players (from whence the saying originally came) know they are at a poker table.

But there is the fact that for a con man Romney was a perfect mark, absolutely self-confident and ready to believe any story of his own superiority.

This comment from honestcoyote's link is kind of amazing:

It just keeps getting worse. My wife and I made the decision over a month ago that we were not going to vote in the presidential race. I had come to the conclusion that both Romney and Obama met the Biblical definition of a false teacher and we are instructed to not give such even a greeting. I understand the nation elects a president not a preacher, but that Biblical principle is sound and applicable in these circumstances. And when I read that on the very day the Graham ads begin to run he is meeting with the Log Cabin Republicans (whose endorsement he ultimately garnered) and when his surrogates in swing states begin telling potential supporters not to worry about Roe v. Wade immediately after the first debate it is sickening.

Evangelicals need to realize that we are called to make disciples and be witnesses for Christ and continuing the fetish we have exhibited for 36 years for political power must stop. Many of our pastors got involved this time. Think about this — we believe that the leaders of nations are chosen in the sovereign providence of God. The mechanism for that choice here is democratic elections, but the result of that choice is in God’s hands. We now have hundreds of pastors who stood in their pulpits, used their God given authority and directly encouraged their people to do something that is demonstrably contrary to God’s will. Encouraging them to vote, to engage in the process by which God’s will works itself out would not be so bad, but to directly advocate for an earthly political leader damages them, impacts their people and raises barriers to making disciples and being witnesses. Every single one should humbly repent and given other Christ followers an example that may help lower those barriers in the weeks and months to come.

I have been truly appalled by the things that have started to come out about this campaign. I believe if we had been following Biblical principles, informing ourselves and demonstrating wisdom and discernment, Christ followers should have just refused to cast a ballot in this presidential race. Neither man, neither campaign was worthy of our support.

Red State: Campaign Sources: The Romney Campaign was a Consultant Con Job

Good lord, the comments on that article. This one:
Dear Reader:

Far be it from me to advance a "conspiracy theory" to explain the results of the 2012 presidential election. I refuse to do that. Frankly, the people who advance such theories on a routine basis make me more suspicious of them than the situation they are describing. But neither do I believe in multiple coincidences. Not when the control of the government of the United States is at issue. Not when the future of the world is at stake. And not when, in criminal law parlance, there is motive and opportunity.

That said, I was taken aback by the election results. They raise in my mind one pivotal question: How could a president who is a pathological liar and has a track record of failure in foreign and domestic affairs--which is obvious to anyone who has been paying attention, manage to win re-election against a candidate who appeared to have the credentials and track record required to rescue the country from the current malaise, and who was in fact prevailing according to credible pollsters until the last minute? 

Big media would have us believe that the election result is attributable to changing demographics. However, that argument assumes that age, race and gender trump judgment. Furthermore, big media tells us that the Republican Party is controlled by the Tea Party, who are racist to the core. Yet they offer no proof. Finally, big media is joined at the hip to Obama, and has undermined every opponent he has had, from Hillary, to McCain, to Romney. It therefore follows that we should be skeptical of any explanation big media presumes to offer, to cover up their own corruption. In legal parlance, their explanations are tainted with bias and/or self interest.

Republicans on the other hand, have their own explanations for the election result. For example, Grass Roots Republicans claim that Romney was not conservative enough. That argument assumes that conservative social issues are wildly popular in battleground states--a dubious proposition at best. Meanwhile, Establishment Republicans offer an entirely different explanation. They claim that their message is fine, but Romney ran a poor campaign, failed to appeal to Hispanics, and lacked the massive ground gameof their opponent. They forget the fact that he was their candidate. They forget the fact that in bad economic times, most people prefer more government help not less.

In my view, none of these explanations suffice. If you set aside conventional wisdom and connect the cots, it becomes obvious that reason Romney lost because the election process itself was rigged--to a degree most of us neither realize, comprehend, or care to admit. The conventional response to that statement is predictable: Tell me who rigged this election and how they did that, so I can disprove what you say, and dismiss you as a tin foil hat job! No thank you. I am not walking into that trap. I will merely refer you to something Ben Hogan said when he was asked a question about his classic golf swing: "Dig it out of the ground like I did". If you investigate the possibility that the election was rigged rather than dismissing it out of hand, and if you are educable, then it is quite possible you will learn something in the process.

To that end, the following fact patterns and anomalies are material:

1. In 2008, John McCain was leading in the polls six weeks before the election. Then came the financial crash. Thereafter he lost the election.

2. Financial markets have been known to crash like this, once every eighty years.

3. Human beings have the ability to cause markets to crash. Soros did this in Britain in 1992, and in Asia in 1998

4. In 2012, Mitt Romney was surging in the polls a week before the election. Then came the hurricane Sandy. Thereafter he lost the election.

5. No prior hurricane has devastated all major battleground states to this degree. Was this the long awaited Was this the long awaited October surprise?

6. Human beings have the ability to manipulate weather patterns. Bush 43 set up project HAARP to generate sand storms in Iraq. Obama has expanded it

7. Voting machines in swing states switched Romney votes to Obama. How widespread this was has not been determined.

8. The DNC targeted Republican Allen West.

9. His vote count changed abruptly, he lost, and a court ordered recount is now in progress

10 The Obama campaign designed its website to accept illegal foreign donations.

11 One of his foreign bundlers Roach is closely connected to the government of Red China.

12 Obama received a wall of untraceable money-- with hidden strings attached to it.

13 Would a market crash or a hurricane visited on the largest battleground states on the eve of the election favor the candidate who advocates big government?

14 Would a market crash or a hurricane divert public attention from a massive cheating operation in battleground states? Or from the Benghazi scandal?

15 Would a mind capable of dropping bombs on a civilian population have moral compunctions against crashing markets and creating storms to secure political power?

Either you believe in multiple coincidences, or you do not. If you believe in them, then you will accept the conventional wisdom and fail to connect the dots. That is how your mind works. But if these fact patterns and anomalies make you curious, or even a trifle suspicious, given all that is at stake, then you will get the sense that maybe--just maybe, you are not being told the truth, and you may find yourself repeating the words of Marc Anthony:" Oh mischief thou art afoot".

Under Obama, we are drifting toward a one party system based on the Chicago model. That model rewards connected insiders, disenfranchises the electorate, bleeds the middle class dry. The American People must question conventional wisdom and start by asking the right questions. Otherwise, the republic will be lost. When Benjamin Franklin emerged from the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia and was asked by a passerby what kind of government we have, he replied "A republic sir--if you can keep it". Nunc pro tunc--then as now. And the quickest way to lose a Republic is to allow unscrupulous politicians like Obama to bribe you with your own money.

Looks like Mitt thinks he lost because of Sandy:
At the Wednesday breakfast, Romney told the donors he believed Hurricane Sandy stunted his momentum in the final week of the campaign, according to multiple donors present.

Although Romney himself stopped short of placing any blame on New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who praised President Obama’s leadership during the storm, several Romney supporters privately pointed fingers at the outspoken governor
At that breakfast one of the supporters attributes Christie's "betrayal" to disappointment, "Christie and his wife were unhappy with Romney’s vice presidential search process, believing they were “led a little bit far down the garden path” without being picked, the fundraiser said." Christie's wife? That's an interesting tidbit to me. Makes me wonder if Ann Romney pulled her aside and started making plans about the two of them taking Washington DC by storm.
In Washington, meanwhile, scores of transition-team staffers who had been preparing for a Romney administration started packing their belongings Wednesday.

Mike Leavitt, the former Utah governor running the transition, convened a conference call at 10 a.m. to inform the staff they had until Friday to organize their files, return their laptops and cellphones and vacate their government office.
Man. You think you've got your dream job....

I'm still curious as to who it was that canceled the Romney staffers' credit cards so quickly. That seems like a dick move. There was an enormous pile of cash for running that campaign, is it all spent? If there are shortages who covers the bills?

The Republicans' resistance to learning anythiing from this teachable moment is breathtaking. Let's see, we've noticed that they...
never did come up with an economic policy (wasn't that the big issue this cycle?) which had any specifics and didn't violate basic arithmetic
alienated every enumerable voting bloc except wealthy white men
drank their own Fox News koolade so enthusiastically that Mitt got caught with his pants down on the Libya thing in the second debate
"unskewed" their own internal polls, rejecting reality in favor of a fantasy that caused them to target the wrong states
did not bother to train or properly credential their volunteers
abandoned traditional GOTV for an untried enterprise-level centralized system which failed spectacularly on deployment
...and the lesson Mitt is drawing from it is...
It's Hurricane Sandy's fault.
Really? How did this moron amass such a fortune without losing it in the sofa? 

And the rest of the party isn't doing any better. With no shortage of real obvious undeniable problems that could be addressed, only a few of the R talking heads are talking about anything that's real, and they seem exasperated that they can't get anybody to listen to them.

"The Onion has been hilarious post-election, but I think they have yet to write a funnier headline than this one from the New York Times: For Romney, All His Career Options Are Still Open. Except One."

I really appreciated that piece though I think for different reasons,
"But aides said that he would be receptive to a high-profile job in the private sector, the advocacy world or academia. 'I know he will do something,' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a longtime Romney political adviser. 'I just don’t know what it will be.' Not on his list of likely jobs: punditry. Friends said Mr. Romney could not imagine following the well-worn path of defeated Republican candidates to Fox News." ... "For now, Mr. Romney has shown up at his campaign headquarters every day since the election, where he seems preoccupied with the futures of members of his campaign staff. He arranged for them to receive severance pay through the end of November. His No. 1 priority, so far: establishing a system to organize the 400 résumés of those staff members whose paychecks will run out in 21 days."
For all of his political craziness, awfully selective empathy, and blind privilege, Romney seems like a fundamentally pretty decent and generous human being with obvious talents and an admirable commitment to public service. In this race he got in bed with some truly awful people but I hope he now finds something nice and productive to do.

Bokmakierie: "Interesting story on the Romney campaign's financial problems and a possible answer as to why he didn't move to the center earlier:"

I suspect this is more spin than anything. If the right wing noisemakers can convince everyone the loss was because Romney was a crappy candidate and not because the message isn't what Americans by and large want to hear, they live to fight another day. 

They are desperately trying to make it Romney's failure, Romney's consultants' failure, anything but the message. Sadly, they will probably succeed once again. It is imperative that Democrats keep the turnout machine going for 2014 or they're going to get shellacked again. Like it or not, old white people are a lot more likely to vote in a midterm election.

Someday they'll learn to put the crazy on the shelf in Presidential years and then we'll be in real trouble.

And we were like, um, no, we heard you twice the first time. Y'all did a *great* job of getting your message out; that's why so many of us didn't vote for you.

Heh, a word from the walrus.

I give a fuck what Romney does with all his free time now, unless he'd like to write a book explaining exactly how morally bankrupt his party had to be for him to run the kind of campaign he ran -- a mea culpa exposé, as it were. 

I'm glad he's working hard to find jobs for his staffers. He always did want to be thought of as a job creator. But these people all came out of the nepotistic world of upper class financial management bullshit, and I feel not a shred of sympathy for their poor little prospects without the governor's good word to old William Citibank Chase the Third or whatever to make sure the handoff is sweet. 

Passed the only Mitt bumper sticker I've seen on any vehicle in NYC this morning as I took my constitutional. It was on a Porsche that I believe runs about $130,000 fully loaded, parked in front of a west village brownstone that would fetch 6-10 million on the open market easy. 

Somehow that was a fine thing to see, a reminder of what all the baloney of their regressive economic argument was about.

> "I suspect this is more spin than anything."

I disagree, actually. This is a known problem that especially affects challengers against incumbents in presidential races. Certain funds aren’t accessible until they accept the nomination at the convention, and the sitting president can fundraise for years and doesn’t have to use up any earlier funds on primaries. It’s part of what sunk Kerry in ’04. Yes, that campaign had many other problems, but the “swift-boating” catastrophe happened in part because he didn’t have the money to respond during the summer months.

When I heard, quite some time ago, that Romney’s plan was to hold back until the final months and then unleash an onslaught of advertising, my very first thought was, “That was Kerry’s born-of-necessity ‘master plan’. Good luck with that. Are they somehow hard up for cash?” Finding out that he blew his years of fundraising on the contentious primaries and then refused to sink his personal fortune into the campaign didn’t really come as a surprise to me after that. The SuperPACs were spending like mad in the summer, of course, but they can’t coordinate with the presidential campaign, which makes direct response difficult.

Even if you think (as I do) that Romney had a lousy message and incoherent policies, do NOT underestimate the importance of having a supply of money in the summer. The fact is, lots of different pieces add together to create a whole. The people who are blaming the loss on Sandy, or on ORCA, or on lack of appeal to Hispanics, or on funding issues, or whatever, aren’t entirely wrong. They’re simply laying all the blame on one piece of the puzzle. A successful candidate can’t alienate every demographic but one, AND ALSO has to offer a more coherent and attractive policy than “Trust me because BUSINESS plus I’m totally not the other guy ”, AND ALSO has to be able to raise gobs of cash and manage it effectively through the primaries and post-primaries, etc., etc.

From reader emails to Andrew Sullivan:
Obama executed quantifiable long-term plans, adaptable short-term planning, an innovative GOTV initiative and plotted better ad strategies, while Romney had the ORCA trainwreck, inaccurate internal polling, poorly informed managers and insufficient fiscal planning (e.g. coffers too low in July to react to the Obama ad blitz seems so minor league!). Not to mention its upper management was rewarded with bonuses in September, right after the languid convention and the embarrassing European trip.

On the macro level, if you take the entire campaign at its face value as a business - a job creator, even? - the Obama campaign had a higher return on investment, ran a better strategy, implemented better tools and metrics to achieve its targets, spent its money more wisely, had a more efficient staff org chart and better managers. In the free market system, it was a strikingly successful example of entrepreneurial acumen. Romney and Rove were beat at their own game.

I'm still irritated by Romney's graceless, perfunctory concession speech. Knowing that he was too arrogant to prepare one in advance doesn't help.

McCain's concession speech in 2008 was a model, and one of the high points of McCain's career.
In a contest as long and difficult as this campaign has been, his success alone commands my respect for his ability and perseverance. But that he managed to do so by inspiring the hopes of so many millions of Americans who had once wrongly believed that they had little at stake or little influence in the election of an American president is something I deeply admire and commend him for achieving.
...
Tonight -- tonight, more than any night, I hold in my heart nothing but love for this country and for all its citizens, whether they supported me or Senator Obama -- whether they supported me or Senator Obama, I wish Godspeed to the man who was my former opponent and will be my president.

I guess I didn't realize how heavily the possibility had been hanging over my head, because it is now four days after the election and I still find myself experiencing random moments of relief (and involuntary grinning) when I remember that my fellow Americans are not, in fact, going to choose an entitled, unscrupulous, say-anything mannequin as our next president.

There was a lingering joy of accomplishment four years ago, but this is something completely different. I'm not naive enough to think that President Obama is the answer to all the country's problems, but America just withstood four years of the republicans playing "let's fuck shit up as badly as we can, and blame it all on the president, because the majority of Americans are stupid enough to fall for it and vote for us again" and it turned out that the majority of Americans are in fact not that stupid. And that actually came as a surprise. A big surprise. A big, awesome surprise that continues to bestow real joy and real hope for the future.

This is actually a big part of my point. Public service should be something that people get properly selected and adequately paid for doing, so that the power and prestige of the roles don't simply accrue to whoever is rich enough to buy his (almost invariably his) way in by devoting the time and resources that other people don't have access to. This is partly because I think it's fair, but largely because I think doing it the traditional way causes a massive distortion of power toward those who already have more than enough.

Real friends stick with you through good times and bad.

By that measure, many of Mitt Romney’s Facebook friends weren’t real friends at all: In the three days after Romney conceded the Presidential election to Barack Obama, more than 50,000 users have unliked his page.

As noted by the San Francisco Chronicle, Romney and Obama were both steadily gaining fans on both Facebook and Twitter through Tuesday evening, though Obama gained about five times as many on both networks.

Soon after Romney conceded the election, though, his social media followers began dropping quickly. Since 11:30 on Tuesday, more than 55,025 users have unliked the Massachusetts Governor, at a rate of about 847 an hour.

ericb linked to this in the other election thread (the 56% one):

The election results are just one indication of larger trends in American religion that Christian conservatives are still digesting, political analysts say. Americans who have no religious affiliation — pollsters call them the “nones” — are now about one-fifth of the population over all, according to a study released last month by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.

The younger generation is even less religious: about one-third of Americans ages 18 to 22 say they are either atheists, agnostics or nothing in particular. Americans who are secular are far more likely to vote for liberal candidates and for same-sex marriage. Seventy percent of those who said they had no religion voted for Mr. Obama, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research.

“This election signaled the last where a white Christian strategy is workable,” said Robert P. Jones, chief executive of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and education organization based in Washington. 

Yes. I wonder long it's going to take the GOP to figure out that it's not that they're failing to get their message out, it's that increasing numbers of people think their message is wrong and bad and awful.

True, but that's immaterial. He's declared income every year since then, mostly investment income. He has declared that he made $13.7 million in 2010; he estimates he made $21 million in 2011.

In related news, let us not forget that he didn't take some tax deductions so as to "'to conform' to Romney's statement last month that he never paid less than 13% in income taxes over the past 10 years."*

Ah, memories of his previous statement:
"I don't pay more than are legally due and frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president. I'd think people would want me to follow the law and pay only what the tax code requires."

Steve Schmidt, a campaign adviser to Senator John McCain in 2008. “He can do whatever else he wants to do.”

He had a warning, though: “Losing a presidential campaign is something you never get over. The question is whether you can move forward without bitterness or rancor.”

Bitterness, of course, may be inevitable. Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain made some halfhearted efforts at postelection comity four years ago, with phone calls and meetings, but have subsequently kept a chilly distance. It is unclear whether the president’s election-night promise to sit down with Mr. Romney was anything more than a polite gesture.

Mr. Romney’s eagerness to work with the president is equally uncertain. Just after conceding, Mr. Romney told those close to him that he was anxious about the nation’s financial health under Mr. Obama.
I cannot fathom the disappointment. On the one hand if you win, you become the most important, the most powerful person in the world, in charge of making decisions that could affect billions of people.

Are the conservative media only hurting conservatives?
For a long time, liberals envied conservatives their media, the echo chamber capable of whipping up stories out of nothing and forcing the mainstream media to pay attention, capable of keeping their troops in line and bucking up their morale, capable of quickly disseminating messages far and wide, creating new stars and enforcing discipline. But perhaps it's time to look at the conservative media as a weakness, even the right's Achilles' Heel.

It isn't only that their media cause them to delude themselves; the effects sometimes bleed out beyond their brains. Consider the single most damaging moment for Mitt Romney in this election, the 47 percent tape. Where did Romney learn that number, wrapped as it was in an argument about the shocking numbers of Americans who mooch off the efforts of virtuous hard-working job creators? He almost certainly got it from Fox or conservative talk radio, where it had been in wide circulation for some time, and if it wasn't directly from listening to Limbaugh or Hannity, it came to him from somebody who did.
The article points out the danger of living in the Republican bubble. FOX reminds its watchers over and over that all other news shows are "lamestream media" that can't be trusted. Therefore when all other news sources reported that Obama was going to win, was winning, had won, the FOX news consumers were sure that was all a lie.

There is a very thoughtful comment after the article (the second one down) which points out how President Obama pays no attention the frothing over at FOX but instead reaches out directly to people like the LGBT community. It makes me realize that a Republican President would probably have to appease the FOX pundits or at least appear to pay attention to them.

David Frum being brutally honest on Morning Joe
I believe the Republican Party is a party of followership. The problem with the Republican leaders is that they're cowards....The real locus of the problem is the Republican activist base and the Republican donor base. They went apocalyptic over the past four years. And that was exploited by a lot of people in the conservative world. I won't soon forget the lupine smile that played over the head of a major conservative institution when he told me that our donors think the apocalypse has arrived. Republicans have been fleeced and exploited and lied to by a conservative entertainment complex....Because the followers, the donors and the activists are so mistaken about the nature of the problems the country faces the nature--I mean, it's just a simple question. I went to Tea Party rallies and I would ask this question: "have taxes gone up or down in the past four years?" They could not answer that question correctly. Now it's true that taxes will go up if the President is re-elected. That's why we're Republicans. But you have to know that taxes have not gone up in the past. And "do we spend a trillion dollars on welfare?" Is that true or false? It is false. But it is almost universally believed. That means that the leaders have no space to operate.
There is more and it is really shocking. He doesn't spin the message or soften it or dumb it down, the media are out of touch with the real concerns of Americans because they, the TV news personalities, all have secure jobs and they all have medical insurance.

Maybe the conservative movement should start off small and actively recruit party members from the majority-coalition of minority and immigrant communities. Seems obvious to me.

Given the Republicans were always going to lose, how much more interesting would the campaign have been had it been Condoleezza Rice running as the hopeful?

That would have been a thriller. Yikes!

Interesting take by the UK paper, The Guardian, on where the Republican Party goes to from here.
Even though the corpse of the defeated Romney campaign is still warm, a bitter fight has started to break out over its meaning in Republican ranks. On one side are the modernists, who understand that the party cannot afford to be seen as a backwards-looking ghetto for white voters. On the other are the nativists, angry at a crippled and ineffective immigration system, who believe that only a true message of pure conservatism will save the day. It is a battle for the soul of the Republican party and the first shots are being fired. "I think it is going to be a war. I really do," said Larry Haas, a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House.
Two of the extremes are Krauthammer "The answer to Romney's failure is not retreat, not apeing the Democrats' patchwork pandering," he thundered. "No whimpering. No whining. No reinvention when none is needed. Do conservatism, but do it better." vs. using Rubio to reach out to Hispanics while softening their stance on immigration.

The Observer goes on to point out that nominating a moderate may have actually prolonged the Republican struggle to redefine itself.
It is not likely to be an easy process. Some believe Romney came close enough to victory to allow an even fight in the coming Republican civil war and thus ensure a protracted and painful debate that will stretch on for years. What the party really needed, some think, was to have nominated a died-in-the-wool ultra-conservative in 2012 such as Rick Santorum or Newt Gingrich who could have led the party to an overwhelming defeat, forcing the reformist wing to triumph. But the selection of Romney denied them that piece of creative destruction, even though the party has now lost the popular vote tally in five of the last six presidential elections. "They are still maybe at the early stages of denial," Bowler said.

Speaking of the GOP, although this is relatively old news I was intrigued about something I read recently-- perhaps in connection to Ted Cruz. It was a mention that the Texas GOP platform included cutting funds for education. I thought "That can't possibly be true. Nobody is that crazy." but I looked it up and yes, it is true:
Since data is (sic) clear that additional money does not translate into educational achievement, and higher education costs are out of control, we support reducing taxpayer funding to all levels of education institutions
I guess one way for them to retain GOP voters is to cut education. Everything I've read shows that the more education you have the likelier you are to vote Democrat. So possibly we will see this platform plank adopted at a national level. What the hell, right? In the Republican play book, anything is OK--voter suppression, lying, smearing the opposition-- as long as the Grand Old Party gets more votes.

Something that strikes me as interesting here is how frequent comparisons are between current GOP rhetoric and their '50s rhetoric — the red baiting and Birchers were dominant in the party then too — miss something that I think is important: In Congress, the Republicans had a minority in part because they were extremists who had preached the same message during the Great Depression and WWII. For the majority of the 20th Century, they were a minority in Congress.

David Frum was pushing that same kind of message (though with a bit less intensity) well prior to the GOP's electoral shellacking, and guys like Bruce Bartlett and David Stockman been sounding some of the same alarms about the GOP's impending electoral doom and intellectual bankruptcy. When I first started noticing it a couple of years ago, I figured they were all just bummed that they weren't part of the conservative power structure any longer, but after seeing them linked from some leftyish blogs, I began to realize that they actually cared about their party, and were just pissed off that the charlatans in charge of it (Limbaugh, Hannity, Drudge, Rove, Norquist, etc.) were destroying it. Frum used to participate in a Marketplace radio program segment where he would represent the Republican point of view on a wide variety of issues, but had to step down when he felt he couldn't represent today's GOP any longer.

I don't think you get to redeem yourself after being "The Axis of Evil Guy", but I do at least respect someone who speaks truth to power and has the integrity to step aside when he isn't really buying what his team is selling. There are so many pundits out there who you can clearly tell are just going through the motions and don't actually believe what they're saying, but love getting a nice paycheck to catapult the propaganda.

I think MSNBC would do well to put a guy like Frum on in the morning instead of Joe Scarborough's three hours of vapid whimsy. Analysis like this fits very well within the MSNBC world view without being explicitly the kind of "Go Team Democrat!" message you get from progressive talkers.

Out of all the stuff that I have read today, and I have read a lot, the piece I can't stop thinking about is Fantasyland by Frank Rich ( thanks to ericb for bringing it to my attention) and in particular this:
Such is the conservative version of history that when the website Right Wing News surveyed 43 popular conservative bloggers to determine the “worst figures in American history” two years ago, Jimmy Carter, Obama, and FDR led the tally, all well ahead of Benedict Arnold, Timothy McVeigh, and John Wilkes Booth.
The Right Wing Media are either liars or insane, I'm not sure which and it probably doesn't matter because they have poisoned America with their toxic bile. And while the Left is enjoying the tears of the Right, we have to remember that we are all Americans-- even the ones that live in a Right Wing Bubble. I know they were taken by surprise that they lost and I know it is their own fault but they are our neighbors and our family and our fellow countrymen and I wish there was somehow we could help them out of the bubble and get back to a place where reason, facts, and logic are all part of our political decisions.

Doing my best by engaging them. Spending real time to debunk the apocryphal stories they're picking up here and there. Doing hard research, going to source data. I'm bringing the facts, reason and logic to them, and showing them the error of their ways.

I'm also being snarky out in the open. I'm not sure how effective that is, but I have a reputation with my friends and acquaintances as a reasonably smart guy. One who used to be conservative. So I hope my disdain for the bs pumped out by the right makes them at least think twice about where I'm coming from, and whether I might have a point.

Otherwise, I really don't know the best course of action. It's not always easy.

One thing I will say, however, is that MetaFilter helped me along in my conversion from conservative to progressive - thoughtful people arguing with me reasonably, based on facts and logic. This was really the first place I ever came across thoughtful, intelligent, eloquent people who were also progressive, and it made me think twice about the 'reality' I'd been taught while growing up.

All his presidential campaigns were hampered by Dewey's habit of making overly vague statements, defining his strategy as not being "prematurely specific"[27] on controversial issues. Truman joked that Republican Party (GOP) actually stood for "grand old platitudes".[29] Walter Lippman, in 1940, regarded him as basically an opportunist, who "changes his views from hour to hour... always more concerned with taking the popular position than he is in dealing with the real issues".[30] Adding to that, he had a tendency towards pomposity[31] and was considered stiff and inapproachable, with even his own aide Ruth McCormick Simms once describing him as "cold, cold as a February iceberg".[32]

From the comments: 

"Hey, I know that elephant! He was a surprise baby at Elephant Nature Park in Chaing Mai, Thailand. ENP is a sanctuary that rescues Asian elephants. Navaan's mama stepped on a landmine. When ENP rescues her, they didn't know she was pregnant and she gave them no indications until one morning, baby elephant! ENP is awesome - elephants roam free, form their own family groups, and generally lead very happy lives. A new baby like Navaan is a reason to celebrate - he'll be safe from mistreatment his whole life and surrounded by elephants and people who love him."

I mean yeah, elephant stepping on a landmine is a terrible thing, but...this is kind of an awesome thing they're talking about here.

From Scody's comment: The conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them.

He just doesn't get it. On my last trip to the US I was chatting to a guy who had flown across the country to get married to his husband in one of the first places it was legal. He was not only married to another man, but he went to Broadway musicals and they had a bunch of small yappy dogs. So, not just partially gay but very gay indeed. He kept banging on about taxes destroying entrepreneurial spirit and welfare being bad for initiative and Obama is just a front for socialists and goodness what. He lives in a gated community and works for an oil company, which incidentally is struggling to survive in the face of anti-business regulation dressed up as concern for the environment. There was something about Afghanistan and Iraq too, but I couldn't follow it.

This man is almost a caricature of a right-wing Republican voter. I have no idea how he voted. Perhaps he voted for Romney, but the Republican party really went ostentatiously out of its way to lose his vote. And why? Because the GOP is against marriage. And it is in favor of government regulation of private life. And there are no more pressing issues for the USA than whether this incredibly conservative guy gets to tick the box which says "married" when he fills out his insurance.

This means it isn't a matter of spreading the Republican beliefs. There are lots of people (gay, Latino, on benefits, dope smokers, whatever) who, for better or worse, already share those beliefs and would likely vote for the Republican Party but don't. Some of them are probably turned off by its bad, very bad candidates; but many of them are undoubtedly pissed off by the fact that the Republican Party has defined them as the enemy. Here is a hint in case anyone from the GOP is reading the Monster Thread: you cannot afford to do this. Not only do you lose those votes, not only does this sort of stupidity swallow up genuine policy development, but the nastiness you encourage turns off other voters - ones who don't care about gay marriage or immigration or anything other than having representatives they can like and respect. 

So drop the politics of division; it's not as though you're ending up with the biggest slice anyway. Focus on reasonable policies and electable candidates and send a memo around that Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh are not welcome any more. From now on you need to be a party that people can vote for. The only question they should have to consider is whether they agree with your message. Because at the moment you are throwing votes away, and you are making yourself look nasty, and hateful, and stupid.

I like Matt Taibbi's take on the republican problem as expressed by idiots like Limbaugh:

There's been a lot of hand-wringing among conservatives of the Rush/Hannity school in the last few days, a lot of concern about this outreach question, and honestly, the tone of the discussion is beginning to sound like the last days of a failed 1950s marriage. The husband who's gone all day at work comes home and throws his hands up in the air in mock frustration: what do you want from me, another Cadillac? Another fur coat? I just got you new shoes last week!

And the wife, who's loved this man for 20 years despite his abject stupidity, just sighs. All she wants her husband to do is listen to her, or take a day off work sometime and take her for a drive in the country, or make some spontaneous show of affection, maybe popping home for lunch like in the old days – just some evidence that he's even faintly aware of what's going on in her head. But when they try to talk it out, things just get worse, because in his very manner of asking her what's wrong, all hubby does is reveal that he thinks of his wife entirely as a nagging, financial parasite who's always on his ass about something.

That sounds more impressive than it is, partially because 1928 sounds like a long time ago. But really only 12 people have been elected President since Hoover, who won the 1928 election, and only five of those were Republicans. Also, what does "a Nixon" mean? It's not as if there were two of them who served as either President or VP.

A less portentous way of saying it would be "The past five Republicans to be elected President of the USA were Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan, GHW Bush and GW Bush. Nixon and GHW Bush also served as vice-Presidents to Eisenhower and Reagan, respectively."

I thought of that, and while it might preclude a run for president one day I'm not sure if that's a barrier to becoming a surrogate (official or not) when Republicans really, really need to raise the profile of women and people of color in their party. I don't recall seeing much, if any, of Jindal, either, for that matter.

I live a few hundred feet from South Carolina and so have followed Haley's career for a while. The adultery claims are nothing new and have never managed to gain any traction in her home state; generally they come across as disgruntled ex-staffers trying to damage her the easiest way they can think of. My take on it is that she is smarter than many people realize and did not want to associate herself with the current crop of losers at the top of the Republican hierarchy; she was born in 1972 and is young enough to bide her time and make a move when it is in her best interest. I think she could really be a contender for the first woman president a few election cycles down the road. Not that I want that to happen or that I agree with her politics, but I think liberals dismiss her at their peril.

The billionaire donors I hear are livid," one Republican operative told The Huffington Post. "There is some holy hell to pay. Karl Rove has a lot of explaining to do … I don't know how you tell your donors that we spent $390 million and got nothing."
This is what happens when you try to buy votes with fear instead of promote goals with information. The GOP machine no longer understands what democracy is, or why it exists. They have been using the government as their personal ATM machine by leveraging relentless lies for so long that they are shocked that people without money get to make decisions about the future of this country.

I have a lot of empathy for the people who are trapped in the propaganda cycle that the GOP has created, but none for puppeteers. If there is evil in this world, it's in the hearts of people who would knowingly prey on the downtrodden so they can wield their political power for one pathetic goal: the parading of more material riches.

Thankfully, it is much more expensive to sell lies as reality.

Republicans do not care about adulterous affairs. Republicans care about adulterous affairs by Democrats.

Their previous Presidential nominee, McCain, is an adulterer. At least one of their major potential Please-Jesus-Give-Us-A-Non-Mitt candidates this time around, Gingrich, is a serial adulterer. 

In fairness, another major non-Mitt, Cain, dropped out after public allegations of adultery, but (1) there were simultaneous allegations of sexual harassment from multiple women, and it seems to me that that's what most of the fuss was made about, and (2) he was back on his feet as a beloved of the Tea Party in no time, with, if I remember correctly, a lot of noise being made like "why oh why did this sainted non-Mitt drop out".

The union between Texas and the other States was as complete, as perpetual, and as indissoluble as the union between the original States. There was no place for reconsideration or revocation, except through revolution or through consent of the States.

I am a little torn about it too, but I do think that "what you say on the internet is public and you are accountable for it" is a lesson that kids absolutely need to learn, and learning it in high school is preferable to learning it by being fired from a job ten or fifteen years later. Me, I would prefer this to be one of the many critical lessons that should be added to the high school curriculum, but hey, sometimes the only way to learn to duck is to get punched in the face.

The best thing would be to contact the parents which might be difficult. The schools, on the other hand, usually have a code of contact (notice that most of the students were team players) and several of the schools were Christian schools. So if, for example, a group of football players wearing their team jerseys were to scream "Go back to Africa ya Nigger" at a passerby, the school would and should be notified. They are representing the school and the school should have a chance to clear its reputation. I was surprised by the last entry where the school did nothing and the twitter account was still active along with the offensive tweets.

I did laugh at the students claiming their accounts had been hacked.

Wow. That Jezebel outing thing is pretty intense. 

I worked through super-conflicted to a state of acceptance. I get that these are "kids" (not all of them actually) from ignorant families in ignorant towns for the most part, victims of the same propaganda machine we mostly deplore here. But goddamit, someone has to shake these communities and their families by the fucking lapels and tell them this is not OK, this is incivil, this is hate speech, this is confusing politics with tribalism, this is un-American. If the kids are the point of the spear, that point needs to hit bare metal and bend. And this extends more broadly into a lesson about citizenship in the digital era. Say whatever you want, the platform is yours. But you may have to own your words. 

None of them are going to suffer anything worse than humiliation or maybe a lost college scholarship or two. And do people who call the President the N-word and wish for his death in a public forum under their own names, teenagers or not, deserve any special consideration from us? 

I don't think so. Sort of a Republican position, actually, but then these kids are mostly also speaking in favor of the Republican party, whose platform enshrines (with all due hypocrisy) a language of individual responsibility, and whose misplaced identities are rooted in a delusional self-perception of superiority owed solely to pigmentation. 

It's their parents who really deserve condemnation though. 

Way to confirm the right's racism, idiots, and the belief of many of us who will always vote against your party precisely because y'all are such bigots. You could have proved us a little wrong, huh? Can't help yourselves, we can't help you either.

bardophile: Children, children... all of those adulterers are men.

Absolutely. I can't think of another female politician with a sex scandal like this. (Unless you count the fringe Hillary/Humana stories.)

And a woman's sex scandal has all sorts of different spin, which is not just conservative sexism. How many times have you read, after a male politician's scandal, "Why is it just men who have this compulsion to cheat? You don't see women politicians doing so." So a philandering woman politician breaks all sorts of dearly held illusions, from a perceived ethical advantage for women politicians to the silly old stereotype that men are dogs and women are saints (math fail: wouldn't there be roughly an equal number of women that those dogs are cheating with?)

Plus, there seems to be a politican rule that the first person caught doing something pays a higher price. Douglas Ginsberg is not on the Supreme Court because he smoked marijuana once, but but politicians routinely admit that now. Even adultery (among men) is becoming old hat. So if this allegation is borne out, I think Haley would pay a real price.

Man, I'm glad somebody else felt weird about that Jezebel link — I don't think the school should be the authority contacted, and I don't think that things written online should necessarily be connected with school or employers. That was one of the few ways that the Reddit thing bugged me, and I finally rationalized it with thinking that ViolentAcrez had probably been being a shit on company time, which is something that I don't have any problem with him being fired for. 

It's one of those things where it's not the school's job to raise these kids to not be fucking racist, but obviously the people who should be doing that job are failing pretty hard.

If I saw tweets from a co-worker, under her real name, like those in the jezebel link, would I let our employer know? Maybe. What if I were a classmate of one of these kids, and saw tweets from someone's real-name account, and knew it was a violation of our school's code of conduct (and also felt grossed out and maybe scared, personally) - should I report it, or not?

Is the thing that makes other folks here have mixed feelings about this the fact that the kids were reported at all, or was it who reported them, or what?

They also included some information about what their schools had to say about it, but that's fairly standard journalism.

If you want to tweet stupid and racist shit and not have it blow back on you, don't link your damn Twitter account to your real life identity. I would understand the reaction if this were hidden/difficult to find information that wasn't already available for the entire damn Internet to see, but that is not what happened. You can't even really argue that it was "accidentally" public, given that it came from their twitter pages and/or tweets in the first place.

I'm not saying Jezebel was wrong to do what they did - kids need to learn these lessons; reporting adults to their employers? I think that's an entirely different situation. And kids will learn from this. But at some point, I think they should be able to put this behind them. Your high school record shouldn't be branded across your life.

This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, and also a serious concern, because it seems like people get the idea of "free speech" in their heads and are then genuinely shocked when people react negatively to what they say. "But... but... the First Amendment!" doesn't fix any of that.

It's not about making me feel better or making these assholes solve their problem. It's about understanding the distinction between nasty shit that people do to other people on the Internet like doxxing and people being stupid enough to say racist things publicly with their names attached.

Honestly, as far as I know, those guys are now accountants and car salesmen and boring shit like that. Lives aren't ruined because things you said/did publicly are out there except in the mind of the drama queens themselves. The rest of us realize that kids do stupid shit and try to find reasons to believe they've learned.

Yeah, as I said above, I'm not at all convinced that Jezebel did this the right way. Other than io9, I am profoundly skeptical of anything that comes out of Gawker and generally I avoid reading them because I think they're the worst sort of tabloid journalism.

No. I'd argue that consequences will silence and therein is the loss of claim to freedom of speech. If I'm refraining from saying something because of the gun at my head my freedom is gone.

But that's my point. The only "claim to freedom of speech" you have is freedom from government censorship. It's not a blanket right. Community pressure against certain kinds of speech is orthogonal to that argument.

Why is this different now from what's been happening before this already?

Because the vast majority of citizens can agree that shoplifting, vandalism etc are wrong. The person knows this and, in theory, if they aren't a sociopath, feel things like shame, empathy and guilt and eventually change their behavior. In this case a good proportion of the local community thinks that calling the president a racial epithet and calling for his resignation/removal/death is perfectly appropriate.

Keep in mind these are kids. They don't get a lot of socializing outside their local high school. When your family, community social networks, religious network, political persuasion is encouraging you and telling you that your conduct is appropriate those things don't work as a behavior changing apparatus. 

Kids don't have the appropriate emotional skill set to push back on that amount of peer pressure that a small, insular, homogenous society can push out. Kids can barely push back when half a dozen other kids tell them smoking is cool. That's what makes them... say it with me... KIDS. If their guidance is faulty there's no hope for them until they get out into the real world and find out that at least half the people in America (not just bleedin' heart libruls on Twitter) aren't hateful bigots and don't approve of their sort of behavior. Penalizing them for being brainwashed by the local cult of hatred does them no service for when they do make it into the real world.

We contacted their school's administrators with the hope that, if their educators were made aware of their students' ignorance, perhaps they could teach them about racial sensitivity. Or they could let them know that while the First Amendment protects their freedom of speech, it doesn't protect them from the consequences that might result from expressing their opinions. (For example, an adult woman is currently being investigated by the Secret Service for calling President Obama a "nigger" and suggesting he be assassinated on her Facebook page.)

I have rarely seen so much po-faced hypocrisy and ignorant vice in a single paragraph.
I bet the author doesn't generally go to this much effort when she sees a racist tweet. She did this to sell page-hits, not because she had some pious hope about education.
The First Amendment restricts government censorship and is an utter red herring in this context.
She is conflating a government investigation of an alleged threat with her own attempt to make some idiots miserable.
The woman who allegedly called the President a "nigger" could have done it as many times as she pleased without legal consequence; she may have broken then law by calling for his assassination.
The author has something in common with the students: they each see people as means, not ends, and they will abuse them to gain advantage.
Where is this woman's school so that I may complain to her principal?

And what I'm saying is, kids were getting publicly confronted with their own idiocy before this. Kids got their names in the local paper for shoplifting, vandalism, etc. And while some of them did stubbornly continue to act out, most of them were embarrassed enough to knock it off. Why is this different now from what's been happening before this already?

Because an HR employee at a company in another state ten years later can't just type in their name and look up every dumb thing they've ever done or said and decide not to bring the kid in for an interview from the local paper before the internet. The local paper is only an infinitely accessible record if someone actually went to the paper and looked at archives or something, which is far, far less likely than some drone sticking a name into google and hitting 'search'.

I cannot believe I am defending racists, but this is classic let the punishment fit the crime, and the punishment of being forever weeded out of the resume pile for saying something dumb as a kid is highly disproportionate.

This is also why I never google people I know - the last thing I need is to find additional reasons to dislike people with whom I'm acquainted.

Well, Jezebel is seriously different than "local paper" or county clerk's records. In the 80s, you could shape up and just move the fuck away. Boom, pretty much tabula rasa. Maybe somebody would go dig up those records if so inclined, but for most things? People didn't give a shit what you did in your home town. The internet is pretty much everywhere and everybody has it. 

Two, Jezebel's not going to the the parents, pastors or scoutmasters of these communities. It'd be seriously different if Auntie Jez was coming over to Johnny's family for the conversation. In this scenario, maybe there'd be some action or maybe the whole family's racist nutbags and things continue as is. With Jezebel announcing their actions, the whole world gets the names, schools and account information of these children. They have no skin in the game and no blood in the community. They're never, ever, ever going to check back on those schools in a meaningful way and they're never going to involve themselves in those kids' lives in a way that will help them correct their actions, either by example or by rote correction. 

Honestly, this should be the latest AHAH moment for why metafilter frowns on "look at these asshole posts".

All the more reason it needs to be publicized. A huge part of the progress in civil rights in the early 1960s came from showing the uglier side of Southern racism to the rest of the U.S. via the media, things that were accepted locally.

Defenders of these kids are also ignoring the way in which public statements of racism are intimidating to all minorities. When such statements are allowed to stand without consequences, this creates an climate of fear and an impression of official approval.

There is no putting this genie back in the bottle, in this case or in general. This is the downside of the Internet, possibly even its dystopian side. But we are all in it now. These kids are native to this world. They know what it means to tweet.

Or they do now.

Of course the upside is that in the future google will know so much shit about everyone that there will no longer be any sense of shame. Problem solved.

The local paper is only an infinitely accessible record if someone actually went to the paper and looked at archives or something....

More accessible than that -- every public library has access to the the Reader's Guide to Periodicals, which is an archive index for just about every newspaper and magazine out there. You then use that index listing to look up the article proper. Your library may not have it, but you can use interlibrary loan to get it from another library.

Mind you, it is indeed easier to look things up now with Google; you're correct in that. But in ye olde days before the Internet, you also didn't see too many kids moving too far out of their home towns, so it's possible the HR person they're facing actually HAD read things in the local paper themselves a couple years back. But you are right that the accessibility of information is a difference between then and now; and honestly, I'm not sure I want to reverse the clock on that.

The consequences of free speech are more free speech. That's how it works.

And msalt's point is key: this is hate speech, intended to intimidate, incite, and demean both the President (whose office supposedly enjoys some deference went the inhabitant is white) and his supporters, as well as African Americans in general. There is a cost to excusing it from whatever non-violent response it earns.

Sure, a google search will bring up the article, but so to can gaining notoriety for making productive changes in their behavior and attitudes. It's not the end of their world for them.

Without taking a stand on whether Jezebel's actions were good or not, there's a real qualitative difference here.

While it is true that tweets are public, unless one of them specifically has attention called to it, you can't really find it in the future except by specifically looking for it already knowing it is there. Certainly just googling the name of one of the kids wouldn't produce it.

On the other hand, googling for one of these kids' names now brings up this story as the first hit I just tried on one), and probably will for years to come.

From the Guardian:

Also-ran? Darwin once came second in an election for a seat in the US House of Representatives.

I never knew that. When did this happen? Last week.

But he's dead! He wasn't alone there. A dead man was elected to the Texas senate last Tuesday. Another dead guy was voted city council president of Rochester, Minnesota, and yet another won a seat on a county commission in Alabama.

OK – but he's not even an American citizen. He wasn't on the ballot either. Nevertheless, Charles Darwin received more than 4,000 write-in votes in Athens-Clark County, Georgia. The numbers from the other 24 counties in the 10th congressional district were not available at the time of writing.


Could he still win? It's unlikely. The incumbent, Republican Paul Broun, received more than 209,000 votes.

And the Democrat? Broun was running unopposed. The write-in campaign was sort of a protest.

But why Darwin? It has to do with a speech Broun gave to a church group in September in which he denounced both evolution and the big bang theory, as "lies straight from the pit of hell".

So he credits Satan with the theory of natural selection? He also said he believed the Earth is 9,000 years old, and was created in six literal days.

Perhaps his remarks were misinterpreted. There's a video of him saying it, standing in front of a wall of mounted deer heads.

I've said it before – that America is one crazy place. It gets worse – Broun is a qualified doctor, a climate-change denier and a member of the House committee on science, space and technology.

Do say: "It's shameful that in this day and age such a politician even exists."

Don't say: "Poor show, Darwin. In America, being dead is no excuse for being second best."

Saying these kids are somehow being severely punished by being roundly mocked for saying something stupid and racist reeks of the persecution complex I've come to expect from those on the right. I suspect some of that may in fact be because they got away with saying stupid, racist shit their entire lives and never got called out on it, but that's just my own pop-psychology analysis.

If you're old enough to drive, you're old enough to know the difference between public and private, not to mention right and wrong. People don't learn and grow by being coddled. Nor do they learn and grow from having the book thrown at them. There is, however, this place in the middle where consequences are not unduly punishing and in fact reinforce the idea that certain behavior is socially unacceptable. And yes, if it makes me a right winger to believe that actions have consequences and that at some point you have to take personal responsibility for things, perhaps those things that you choose to make come out of your mouth (or you choose to post to twitter!), I'm guilty as sin. A regular tea partier, I am.

Of course, I'm also one of those people who has stupid teenage shit out there associated with his real identity and easily searchable on the interwebs, so maybe I'm just arguing that it doesn't really matter in the end if they turn themselves into decent people so that I can feel better about myself.

We all make mistakes or do something stupid and poorly thought out. As this goes, it's not particularly bad - compared to say a DUI or what have you.

So there I was…

A Facebook friend who said he was driving to Florida to "help with the Allen West recount" posted a rather breathless comment about voter fraud in the Florida District 18 race:
This all started when we were asked to help Alan West recount votes in Florida. I noticed something about the voting districts. That all had over 100% of registered voters vote. Furthermore some counties has 170% of the vote. This is an official PDF for St. Lucie County. This is not a blog this is the government site. This caused me to stare in shock as Florida was about to validate 15+ counties that had obvious election fraud. So I started digging around.

Florida
Pennsylvania
Ohio
Colorado This one is not “guaranteed fraud”, just stated there are more people registered to vote than population. 

There is no way to write this off as a legitimate election. even democrats have to see that 150%+ of the vote is invalid.
I wasn't interested in trying to tease links to actual information out of what people had to say on their blogs, but that link to the PDF of election results was worth investigating on an afternoon when my team lost because the O-line got blown up on a 3rd and Goal run play. Some copying and pasting later, I had a spreadsheet, and what I think is a reasonable conclusion.
[T]he explanation is right on the slcelections.com website. "NOTE* - TURNOUT PERCENTAGES WILL SHOW OVER 100% DUE TO A TWO PAGE BALLOT. NOT ALL VOTERS VOTED THE SECOND CARD CONTAINING THE AMENDMENTS"

Even so, I decided to do my own analysis of the data you provided. I picked four precincts at random and added the one you were concerned about "093 Gold Pond Rec Ctr - County" that had the 171% turnout. All of the data in the attached spreadsheet comes from the PDF you linked. 

Comparing the "Times Counted" columns for Rep. West's race and Amendment 1, it appears they both appeared on the first card of the ballot. My analysis of the data in the PDF suggests that all of the political races plus Amendments 1 through 3 were on the first card, with the remainder of the amendments on the second card. 

As can be seen in the spreadsheet, I compared the vote totals for House District 18, Amendment 1, and Amendment 4. It is clear that the totals for Dist. 18 and Amd. 1 are the same, while the total for Amd. 4 is somewhat lower. Adding the totals for Dist. 18 and Amd. 4 you arrive at the "Cards Cast" number from the "Turn Out" sheet. From this we can conclude that there was no systematic over-vote in St. Lucie County.
Moral: "A lie will go round the world while truth is pulling its boots on."

Alright, Talez, I give up - -what do YOU think is the appropriate thing to do with these kids?

Speak to them privately. Therapy. Normalizing relations with minorities wouldn't go astray. Sociologists need something to do. Fund a few grants and send a few of those into small town America to try and figure out how to start ending endemic racism. That way maybe we can get the parents to guide these kids properly instead of trying this "make an example" patchwork solution.

They don't need to, though. In the first (worst?) case, that racist nonsense won't be a factor, or possibly a net positive. In those situations where it might matter, do what other people do when faced with bad publicity - swamp the bad thing with good things.

You know what I've personally never heard an HR person say in my life? "Let's take a chance on this person". In an ever-increasing competitive environment highly publicised youthful stupidity is a massive liability.

To turn Ms Callipygos's example back on herself, Monica Lewinsky. This is where mob justice style shaming notoriety goes, folks. Thankfully she's got a memoir with titillating stories about an ex-president to fall back on since she can't seem to shake her notoriety.

> "You Keep Saying That, but He Won, Karl, He Won"

Oh, incidentally? That claim that Rove made in that clip? That little factoid he and others have been throwing around the Obama is, and I quote, “the first president in history to win a second term with a smaller percentage of the vote than he did in his first term”? ...

Andrew Jackson: First term, 55.93% of the popular vote. Second term, 54.74%.
Grover Cleveland: First term, 48.85% of the popular vote. Second term, 46.02%.

Well, maybe they misspoke? Maybe Obama was the first in history to win a second term with a smaller electoral vote?

Woodrow Wilson: First term, 435 electoral votes. Second term, 277 electoral votes.

Well, perhaps they meant the first in history to win a second term with a smaller popular vote count?

George freakin’ Washington: First term, 38,818 votes. Second term, 13,332 votes.

Yep. Just a lie. Lie as phrased, lie even if you think they were trying to say something else.

Thing is, they could even have said something true. While it’s irrelevant to his victory, it’s not unreasonable to point out that Obama’s popularity seems to have waned somewhat. It’s even potentially relevant to break that down by demographic and discuss why.

But nope. He has to be the “first ever”, even though he is not, because he must be Hitler Satan Stalin Nomandate Guy! They are so, so confident, even now, that no one is going to call them on it, no one is going to just go “wait, is that true?” and look it up on goddamn Wikipedia, and that even if some people do look it up, plenty of people will believe the lie anyway. Because they want to.

And you know what? It probably mostly works. Because they say it with confidence and authority and would they really, really, just flat-out lie that blatantly right on record like that? I only looked it up because, at this point, if Karl Rove told me it was raining I would start slathering on sunscreen. But even I sort of half-expected to find out he was telling the truth because really? Would he really just totally lie about a number I can just look up?

Yes, he would. Yes, they do. Yes, he did. Arg.

I will take solace in the fact that at least in the election, IT FINALLY BIT THEM IN THE ASS.

Let me rephrase. People they somewhat respect speaking to them privately. I'm just spitballing ways on how to start looking at why racism happens at its core (which is what really needs to be done to solve the root problem) which is far diverging away from the "putting a permanent black mark against their name is neither effective or productive nor does it encourage a person to try and redeem themselves later in life" I'm trying to make.

I hate having to defend these people. But making them into martyrs for the racist underbelly of society is counterproductive and only makes us feel better because we're trying to shame and punish some racist kid somehow.

That's really why I think Jezebel went about this the wrong (if controversy- and therefore click-generating) way. If they'd talked in general about high school kids' racist tweets, even reproduced some of them anonymously, and then talked about the schools' responses, that would have been interesting, thought-provoking, and not ethically questionable. (I don't have a problem with them contacting the school. That is a reasonable way to get someone that the kid has a chance of respecting to intervene in this really dumb and potentially self-defeating behavior.) But, being Jezebel, they outed everyone involved and moved the discussion onto the site's typically shoddy ethics rather than the actual subject of the story.

Yep, I’m going to label it that way.

Only after the first debate did I start to think Romney could win (and frankly, given the way some of you people reacted when I said the polls weren’t rigged, I’d have kept my mouth shut if I thought otherwise), but for five years I have been saying roughly what is now happening would happen — Romney would be the nominee, lose, and the GOP would start trying to throw the conservatives out in an effort to redefine conservatism.

And yes, after weeks of hysteria from even some readers of this site for me not been keen on Romney, his team, telling you all the polling was not rigged and he was running behind, etc. I now post in its entirety a post I wrote one year ago on November 8, 2011.
His old post was called "Mitt Romney as the Nominee: Conservatism Dies and Barack Obama Wins."

I haven't decided what I think about this, but I had already seen ericb's map along with some images aggregating the racist Tweets online, on Facebook, by a couple days after the election and long before the Jezebel post. And a few other outlets presented them in a way in which you could see usernames, some of them also with further identifying information from Google research. So this post doesn't represent outing something that wasn't already out there. The difference was in taking the step of contacting schools.

But you are the one who seems to be making them into martyrs. When people do stupid stuff in public, they get criticized for it, and it may affect their job prospects in the future. As it should.

It's possible they may be unintentionally racist, or glibly repeating parents' slogans, but they may very well also be deeply evilly racist. The one thing we know for a fact is, they chose to broadcast racist messages to the public. Future HR directors should be able to know that, and at the very minimum these kids should at that time be forced to explain what was going on and how (if) they are different.

There are literally millions of minority kids getting actual criminal records for minor crimes, weed and false accusations. I just can't fathom how that's no big worry, but white, actively racist kids deserve protection against the natural consequences of their action.

I actually was being perfectly serious. As near as I could figure your argument, you were claiming that being smeared in a tabloid was a setback that was too great an obstacle for people to overcome. I was pointing out an instance where someone seemed to have done so just fine. I'd honestly missed your disclaimer in which you were referring to "ordinary people," although I'm not sure that it matters. But my point - that there are plenty of people who have indeed overcome being called out and gossiped about - still stands, and was not made in the pursuit of being facetious.

For the record I've talked about this too (it's an abhorrent practice by the "justice" systems involved) and I've also had a discussion at length with Valkyrn about the role of punitive/retributive/rehabilitative aspects of prison (at which I'm very much in favour of pure rehabilitative approaches). If you'd like to make an FPP about the shitty and unfair state of excessive minority convictions for petty, trivial bullshit I'll be happy to write about the topic and support you at length.

Jeez, I think these kids were stupid, but they were kids. I don't think doing drugs should make you lose your college funding and I don't think that saying dumb shit on the internet before you were old enough to know better should prevent you possibly being hired in the future. Seriously, people think that would be a good thing? A progressive way to handle prejudice and ignorance? That someone's bad choices should haunt them the rest of their lives? I'm pretty sure I called other girls "sluts" at some point as a teenager. That's ugly and prejudicial and I grew out of that kind of thing. I can't even imagine how invasive and non-relevant it would be to have someone looking at my resume only to ask, "so, when you were seventeen you called Margaret Thatcher a ' brainless slut' and a 'leathery old cunt'. Care to explain that to me?" That's fucking dystopian. 

you don't combat racism by holding people responsible for ugly things they said as children many years later. You simply don't.

Because they're minors. We erase the police records for most violations committed by minors once they turn 18. Can you guarantee that this isn't going to follow them after that? I think that's the big objection.

If Jezebel had blocked out the names/pictures (like many of these kinds of things did after the election) and then contacted the schools or whatever authority behind the scenes, that would have been great. I'm not too excited about pillorying minors.

It's pretty terrible that some teenagers who posted racist tweets enduring potential consequences for their actions keeps being compared to lynching. To me, it completely undermines your argument.

And, once again, the very real bad that has been done - the racist tweets - is being minimised when compared to the potential harm that could befall those who have now had their misbehaviour exposed. It comes across as saying, "Sure, they were racist, and that's bad, but that doesn't mean they should lose a job for it ten years down the line." If we're speculating about the consequences in such terms, perhaps they'll be more likely to get a job because the person hiring them is also a racist.

... and for anyone who thinks this is the same as some small town paper publishing the names of juvenile offenders, where I come from, and in many places today (I'm not going to make assumptions about anyone's actual small town papers and what their practices were) juveniles' names are kept out of the papers. Setting aside the scant chances of anyone publishing the names of a teenager that spewed hateful racist shit (which is not illegal in America, however fucked up it is) in a newspaper, kids' names are generally not published because the expectation is that they can be rehabilitated, and that people who are not yet adults should not be held accountable for the rest of their lives for poor judgement. This has been the practice for years, taking into account the much more onerous task of searching newspapers compared to Googling. It's why we don't try minors as adults either, and why young people cannot give informed consent.

Do the people arguing that since the kids deleted their accounts this should all go away realize that the Library of Congress is archiving tweets? You seriously think that won't be googleable soon? Again, the reason why I can't be bothered to give a shit is because they chose to make these public statements. Public is different than private. You know that by the time you're in high school. Hell, you've probably taken shit for posting things publicly that you should have kept to yourself by the time you're in middle school these days.

It serves no one to bury this stuff. Not even the kids, who will be deprived of a learning experience that isn't all that costly in the grand scheme. Many folks have to learn their lessons a lot more..violently.

Yes, to explain "free speech does not mean freedom from consequences," I always use the example of John Galliano shouting anti Semitic slurs in Paris. In France, you can be prosecuted for such a thing and Galliano was brought up on charges. He was also fired from Dior. 

In the US, our free speech laws make it so that Galliano could not have been brought up on charges. But he could still be fired.

So Lindsey Graham and the Republicans are coming back to the table on immigration:
“It’s one thing to shoot yourself in the foot,” Graham said on CBS’ “Face The Nation,” referring to GOP support among Hispanics. “Just don’t reload the gun.”

“So I intend not to reload this gun when it comes to Hispanics,” he said. “I intend to tear this wall down and pass an immigration reform bill that’s an American solution to an American problem. But we have nobody to blame but ourselves when it comes to losing Hispanics. And we can get them back with some effort on our part.”
I guess if there's an issue that's tearing your party apart from the inside, which you can't even talk about without stinking up the airwaves with hateful shit that costs important votes, you would like there to be a "bipartisan" solution to this immediately after a big election.

If in the future these kids' words come back to legitimately affect their adult lives, well and good. They'll have some explaining to do. But naming and shaming children, with or without punitive consequences, is as ugly as what the kids are doing.

The dems would get something out of immigration reform no matter what (a few million new voters who historically lead Democratic, which is one reason why the GOP will be very resistant to it). Immigration reform could be a poison pill for the GOP or an antiseptic, but either one is a win for the country.

I think it would be good leadership for Obama to give the Republicans the lead on immigration reform almost entirely, maybe in exchange for a decent deal on the fiscal cliff and more stimulus. It would add to his legacy as a potentially great President.

Journalism is a for profit enterprise, 99% of the time. It also serves an important social function, illuminating outrages and mobilizing social opinion against them, as it did in the Civil Rights Movement. The former does not invalidate the latter. Both have been part of the nature of journalism since the 1700s.

As for the kids "making mistakes," I would agree with you if they sent private racist text messages to their friends. It would then be wrong to publish their identities. But tweeting is publishing, done intentionally to reach a large -- worldwide -- audience. It's more like they were putting up racist posters, or sending a letter to the editor with their hate speech. They are the ones who chose to enter the public sphere, and they don't deserve any protection from the consequences of that.

So after the single friend who's even remotely conservative (#firstworldproblems) posted about Texas seceding from Facebook I decided to look at the situation from a pragmatist sort of view and what would happen if they did actually secede. This is what I came up with:

Keep in mind if you were to secede you'd not only lose the US military bases and facilities that Texas houses (Fort Hood, Fort Bliss, Fort Sam Houston, Corpus Christi, etc) but also the nice high paying jobs that Lockheed Martin brings to the area (since a fair whack of that defense work being done by the US DoD is no "foreigners" allowed) along with Bell Helicopter Textron along with just about any other DoD contractors.

FAA regulations would mean you lose both AA and Southwest since if they were headquarterd in Texas they'd be counted as foreign airlines and not allowed to sell domestic route tickets. Clear Channel? That's moving away from Texas since the FCC says a broadcast station, for all intents and purposes for this conversation, can't be owned by foreigners.

You'd keep the oil companies. They'd probably become the driving force behind the economy of the New Texan Republic. But the hit from losing all that military and high paying, high benefit defense work is going to be a massive hit.

While we're on the economy let's take a look. You'd need your own currency. Is it pegged to the USD? You need hard currency to make that work. Floating? Interest rates? Since you're now a population of 25 million instead of part of the world's biggest economic power you can look forward to paying a 2-4% premium over the United States on your interest rates to attract foreign exchange into the country. Instead of 2-3% inflation expect 3-5% inflation as well. Bonds would be a much higher rate and unless you can quickly establish a AAA credit rating you're going to be paying 3-5% on bonds. Don't expect your current debtors to automatically shift their bond contracts over to the new Texan dollar either so you'd have to work through all that existing debt and pay it in USD. If the currency sinks you will be absolutely screwed. Run out of hard currency? That's another hike to interest rates thank you very much.

Citizenship. Since the US State Department doesn't officially acknowledge dual citizenship they'd probably start revoking the US citizenship of those who declare loyalty to the Texan Republic. You'd lose your SSN too. The Texan Republic would either need to quickly arrange for visas or deportation for non-citizens who wish to remain loyal to the United States otherwise the exercise becomes kind of moot. Since you wouldn't have access to the Visa Waiver Program right away you'd need a visa to head out of your fledgling country back into the United States. You ever had to apply for a US visa? You're in for a treat. A few of you will probably be denied entry to the US entirely due to strict entry requirements. You get to be harassed at every land border like Canadians.

Let's head back to defense. Remember 1846-1848? Well turns out the Mexicans are still pretty pissed about that. And there's more of them that live within 100 miles of Mexico City then what you have in your entire country and you have oil. Their total population? 110 million. About four and a half times as much as Texas. You don't have access to that cool "foreign" US technology anymore. You don't have a navy that can beat the entire G8 combined. You just pissed off the only people that could really protect you from an invasion. Don't get me wrong, you guys would assemble a hell of a militia and put up a hell of a fight but Mexico has been fighting a drug war for the past three decades. They can and will probably fight in the streets better than you.

The US might defend you but they'd would want your oil for it. You'd treat them as liberators and they'd have your hearts and minds as an M1A1 comes rolling into San Antonio but at that point you've gone from a US state to an occupied country. What exactly was the point of this exercise again?

tl;dr: Seceding is fun idea for liberals and conservatives alike but not as simple as it says on the box.

Since the US State Department doesn't officially acknowledge dual citizenship they'd probably start revoking the US citizenship of those who declare loyalty to the Texan Republic.

They might start revoking citizenship if you take an oath of allegiance, although the State Dept's lack of official acknowledgement doesn't keep many, many American citizens from maintaining citizenship in other countries as well.

Dual citizenship for US citizens picking up another citizenship seems to be a DADT situation for sure. The onus is on the state department to prove that the citizen knew they'd lose their citizenship by swearing an oath to a foreign power.

Splitting a country though? That'd certainly be a different kettle of fish.

Re: Texas seceding, there would be a looot of companies with operations in Texas who would pull out of the state and put those resources back into making money in the US, rather than waste assets on the sure-to-rapidly-tank economy of a seceded Texas.

Also, Texas would become an irresistible chunk of territory for the drug cartels. It would take some time for the US government to set up half-decent border security around the US-Texas border, and the feds would have pulled out along the Texas-Mexico border. Drugs would be able to flow into the US through Texas like water through a sieve.

On the plus side, suddenly Texas wouldn't have a say in US public school textbooks!

It's even more than that. Current policy is that you have to do one of the things listed in your passport (that's a fairly comprehensive list, I think) with the intent to renounce US citizenship. The part that makes dual citizens (well, me, anyway) paranoid is that this is State Department policy and not a matter of law. I think the current belief is that this may be the only policy the courts would ultimately allow.

My problem is that an ordinary person can't possibly show remorse that will achieve public notoriety similar to the publication of their hate speech in widely read and indexed tabloid news.


Awwwww. Have they even tried? Didn't think so. Not one public apology yet. Most won't even own their own words.

No, they'll probably have to take some leadership in educating their peers in anti-racism to have some nice little stories written about them in the future to replace Jezebel at the top of Google results for their names. Or do something else commendable and worthwhile with their lives. God forbid and probably unlikely, but sincere and sustained repentance is a path to restored reputation, and that's a good life lesson.

It's not like Metafilter to feel so sorry for teenage bullies. 

We all did stupid shit as teenagers. But not all of us were racists or bullies. These aren't children. They're 16 and 17. They get off on being hateful and hurtful, which is sociopathic behavior. Good riddance to their reputations, but the claims of irreparable physical harm are laughable. If this is ok speech in their communities, let 'em find colleges and jobs there. Otherwise, kids, welcome to America in 2012, sorry your parents and peers we're so ignorant and hateful, grow up and change. Or don't. Who cares?

hoyland: I need to find out more about how this works. For instance, if I were to apply for and obtain citizenship in a country that requires me to give up citizenship in any and all other countries in order to get citizenship, does that count as doing something 'with the intent' to renounce citizenship?

I could apply for citizenship in, Austria, the country where I currently live. I'm a US citizen, born and raised in the US to two parents who were also citizens. I can actually trace my family name and ancestral line back to at least 1623 in the US, so we've been here a while, not that it's really important to the citizenship question :)

Anyway, I'd be interested in applying for citizenship here in Austria, but I'm not ready to give up my US citizenship, yet. Need to figure the ins and outs of all of that.

Depends on Austria, I believe. Some countries make you renounce your previous citizenship properly before naturalising you, in the sense of going to the US consul and renouncing. Other countries don't mention renouncing or do what the US does, where there's a renunciation in the oath that lots of countries don't recognise (but some do or ban dual citizenship outright). Obviously don't trust me on this, but I believe that's how things go.

The Republican polls were wrong. There were completely wrong and they were always wrong. But not to worry! They are now spinning it as their polls were right, right up to the end when Romney screwed up. Yes that's right. It is all Romney's fault for sucking as a candidate.
“Clearly, I think the one takeaway here is, all indications are we did a good job on the early vote but lost the vote on Election Day and that is not the trend in past campaigns,” said Goeas, whose firm worked for winning Senate campaigns in Nevada and Arizona. “It seems like [Democrats] got a little boost at the end.”

Pollster John McLaughlin — who produced Mourdock’s upbeat poll and worked for unsuccessful Senate candidates in Connecticut and Virginia — argued that Republican candidates may have experienced a drop-off in support at the end, thanks to Romney’s weakness at the top of the ticket.

“In the last week he was really collapsing, and on Election Day he really did collapse,” McLaughlin said. “The incumbents who had a longstanding image were able to withstand it. The challengers we had? It was like, ‘Oh, you’re with him.’ ”

That tatoo guy has changed his story. The LA Times wrote back in October 29
ndependent pro wrestler Eric Hartsburg, who I'm assume wrestles under the name The Ultimate Idiot, auctioned off tattoo advertising space on his face for $15,000 on EBay.

The winner, who has yet to be named, chose the logo of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Hartsburg had the tattoo placed on his right temple.

But get this: Not wanting to settle for just $15,000, he plans to auction off tattoo space on his forehead next.
So his story differs by the amount of money ($5,000 vs. $15,000) and where the idea came from for using the Romney logo (his choice vs. the choice of a winner of an auction.)

Wonder what version he told his wife?

Yeah, that's pretty much a textbook definition of irony, but I was wondering the same thing, whether there's a term for phrases that always function with that sort of irony at their core. 

[For what it's worth, I think "classy" doesn't count; in certain subcultures it's probably only being used with the sort of sarcastic sneer I assume you're thinking of (like a sneering "way to go, slick; real classy."), but there's definitely non-ironic usage still out there ("The non-profit's apology was nothing if not classy"). That said, using "classy" in any sense might ultimately be classist? But that's a whole separate thought.]

And what I'm saying is, kids were getting publicly confronted with their own idiocy before this. Kids got their names in the local paper for shoplifting, vandalism, etc. And while some of them did stubbornly continue to act out, most of them were embarrassed enough to knock it off. Why is this different now from what's been happening before this already?

I think for me, a major point about what is happening here is that Jezebel has shifted from reporting the news (Hey, teens are making racist tweets!) to making the news themselves (by contacting the kids' schools.) And it's pretty clear that they are not doing it for journalistic reasons, ie to follow up on a story, but explicitly to get children punished, and they're doing it with the weight of their organization.

Not cool to me. Not even the tiniest bit. 

It's even more than that. Current policy is that you have to do one of the things listed in your passport (that's a fairly comprehensive list, I think) with the intent to renounce US citizenship.

I mean, I feel like I'm pretty used to people picking up citizenship in, say, their parent's birth countries or what have you as dual citizenship pretty easily, and have never heard that the US might have a problem with it. I've even thought about it myself, I am qualified for dual citizenship. (Actually, triple citizenship, but I don't think anywhere lets you do that.)

The Auto-Bailout Didn't Decide Ohio by Nate Cohn. Excerpt:
When Obama’s national standing faltered after the first presidential debate, polls showed Obama falling behind in the “new coalition” states while maintaining a slight but consistent lead in the key Midwestern battlegrounds, including Ohio. The president seemed to be defying gravity, and the Obama campaign told reporters that Ohio was the crux of the “midwestern firewall” that provided the president with a critical and durable advantage in the Electoral College. With the polls showing Obama ahead by 3 points with more than 49 percent of the vote, the state appeared poised to provide the president with reelection.

And yet Obama won Ohio by a smaller margin than Virginia or Colorado and only finished one point better in Ohio than he did in Florida. While many believed that the auto-bailout and attacks on Romney as an out-of-touch plutocrat would allow the president to win the state with the support of white working class voters, the exit polls show that Obama did worse among Ohio’s white voters than John Kerry. This was not true, however, in the other Midwestern battleground states like Wisconsin and Iowa. Moreover, if there was anywhere that the president should have excelled due to the auto bailout, it would have been northeast Ohio. But the president lost northeastern Ohio’s two classic white working class bellwethers: Lake County, home to the overwhelmingly white suburbs and exurbs east of Cleveland, and Stark County, home to Canton. The president also lost additional ground in traditionally Democratic stretches of eastern Ohio, where Obama performed worse than any Democrat since McGovern in a stretch of “coal country” along the Ohio River. And Obama’s problems weren’t limited to eastern Ohio. The president performed poorly in southwestern Ohio, including one deeply conservative and culturally southern county where Obama’s performance was the worst by a Democrat since at least 1868.

There's actually a Supreme Court ruling that dual citizenship cannot be illegal. In a later case, SCOTUS again reaffirmed that "the trier of fact must in the end conclude that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his citizenship."

In that second case, the man ended up losing his US citizenship because he made conflicting statements about whether he had intended to relinquish his US citizenship when he applied for a Mexican certificate of nationality. Note that the court ruled that simply making the oath of citizenship would NOT be sufficient to lose US citizenship.

(IANAL, just someone who has had good reason to be interested in US law on dual citizenship.)

Washington Post: GOP’s Red America forced to rethink what it knows about the country. Excerpt:
[Beth Cox] turned on her computer and pulled up an electoral map that she had filled out a few days before the election. She had predicted the outcome twice — once coming up with a narrow Romney win and once more with a blowout.

Florida: red.

Colorado: red.

Virginia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin: all red.

Everything in her version of America had confirmed her predictions: the confident anchors on Fox News; the Republican pollsters so sure of their data; the two-hour line outside her voting precinct, where Romney supporters hugged and honked for her handmade signs during a celebration that lasted until the results started coming in after sundown. Romney’s thorough defeat had come more as a shock than as a disappointment, and now Cox stared at the actual results on her computer and tried to imagine what the majority of her country believed.

“Virginia went blue? Really?” she said. “Southern-values Virginia?”

“And Colorado? Who the heck is living in Colorado? Do they want drugs, dependency, indulgence? Don’t they remember what this country is about?”

Now would be a good time for some sort of organized campaign to get people to "take a Fox break" or something like that. A challenge to spend one week watching another news outlet or just reading a major newspaper instead of subsisting on the constant Fox IV. They're a big part of the problem.

Even getting away from TV cable news helps. I get most of my news from NPR stations, news sites, news papers and news magazines, and when I flip on the TV - even to a mainstream network - it seems like another reality entirely. The visual medium means there's a demand to present (even to choose the topics of) news differently. And the need to maintain eyeballs and advertisers in particular, high-drama, suspense-filled ways twists editorial choices too.

Dowd:
Team Romney has every reason to be shellshocked. Its candidate, after all, resoundingly won the election of the country he was wooing.

Mitt Romney is the president of white male America....

In its delusional death spiral, the white male patriarchy was so hard core, so redolent of country clubs and Cadillacs, it made little effort not to alienate women. The election had the largest gender gap in the history of the Gallup poll, with Obama winning the vote of single women by 36 percentage points.

As W.’s former aide Karen Hughes put it in Politico on Friday, “If another Republican man says anything about rape other than it is a horrific, violent crime, I want to personally cut out his tongue.”...

Until now, Republicans and Fox News have excelled at conjuring alternate realities. But this time, they made the mistake of believing their fake world actually existed. As Fox’s Megyn Kelly said to Karl Rove on election night, when he argued against calling Ohio for Obama: “Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better?”

Romney and Tea Party loonies dismissed half the country as chattel and moochers who did not belong in their “traditional” America. But the more they insulted the president with birther cracks, the more they tried to force chastity belts on women, and the more they made Hispanics, blacks and gays feel like the help, the more these groups burned to prove that, knitted together, they could give the dead-enders of white male domination the boot.

I see what you mean, and yet at least the willingness to do that, and treat other people's shoes with some dignity even if you lack the imagination to put yourself there, is a key skill for citizens in a representative democracy. Part of that inability is encouraged by bubbles of isolation and rightness like the one she is living in. She sounds like a smart and earnest person who's made different choices than I, but the disconnect she has from people who don't live like her allows her to turn them into monsters in her imagination, people who have strayed far from God's path. It also allows her to assume that the role of government should be promoting her religious values, and if it isn't doing that, something is wrong. These aren't just failures of imagination but of understanding the workings and civic values of a pluralistic democratic nation.

Never mind that "not going well" is a pretty vague description.

However, more realistically: states looking to secede are generally states where the Republican won by an enormous enormous margin. This election has let them realize, once again, that it isn't enough - that their state will never, ever, have enough impact on the direction of the country in order for them to feel that they have adequate representation.

Lack of adequate representation was in fact a large part of the reason for the secession of the Colonies. It could, in fact, be viewed as one of the greatest intolerable acts that can be committed - to rule a people without giving them a chance to contest that rule. 

We had that debate during the Lincoln administration. Had it quite vigorously, as it turns out.

This election has let them realize, once again, that it isn't enough - that their state will never, ever, have enough impact on the direction of the country in order for them to feel that they have adequate representation.

Not only is this not analogous to the situation in the Colonies, where people had no direct representation (which is different from just losing in a national contest of the popular or electoral vote), but if this is a problem for some people, unfortunately it is going to plague them in any non-dictatorial enterprise. Sometimes in a contest of opinion, your point of view is the one that loses. It doesn't mean you weren't represented, it doesn't mean you take your toys and go home, it means you lost. It means your view did not win the opportunity to prevail for some short-term known period of time ahead. 

The Civil War communicated that you can try to secede, but when you do it's against the Constitution and the agreement your state's founders made to ensure the protections of Federal government that brought you the security and prosperity you know today, and if you try it, we'll go to war to preserve that agreement and the integrity of the nation. This isn't a case of "might makes right;" it's a contest of principles. If the principles have failed under rule of law, and that means those espousing those principles decide to take arms, their ideas have already failed under the system, and they are just unhappy with the outcome. 

Believe me, there's been many a time I've flippantly said "just let the assholes go and try to run their own country," but as an American I believe in upholding the confedaracy of the states. They thought about this long and hard, and the solution they came to wasn't "....until you don't like the guy in charge," or "unless you feel like things are headed in the wrong direction;" it was "perpetuity." A deal was made, a deal must be honored.

When liberals lose elections they contemplate moving somewhere more amenable; when conservatives lose elections they threaten to shoot people. Go figure. Now these Yahoos may feel a lot of things, but in fact they have the same degree of representation as every other American voter, so I'll remind them of the advice they repeated endlessly after the Supreme Court helped George Bush become President in 2000. GET OVER IT.

Actually, due to malapportionment in the Senate (which is mirrored in the Electoral College that chooses the President) the voters in primarily rural states who are making the most noise are, in fact, over-represented relative to blue states with big cities in them.

You will get no quibbles from me on the illegality of the kill list, indefinite detentions, and drone program, but I will note that there was no mass petitioning from these people under the Bush administration that engaged in the same activities. Do you seriously think any of these people are petitioning to secede because we're keeping suspected terrorists indefinitely?

Well, there was no mass petitioning from these people under the Bush administration at least partially because there was no national site set up guaranteeing an answer once you got to 25,000 signatures - which is one of the things the Obama administration has set up that I actually do like. Beyond that, it's all speculation. I'll give you that at least some of the people signing are probably just miffed because it's Obama, but I'm also seeing wide sharing of this in libertarian circles, and I will probably sign at least a few myself just to see what the Obama administration will answer/to support the right of people to peaceably leave. I think we just can't really know what the motivations of individuals are without knowing the individuals involved - even my own suggestions are just speculations.

Well, he did sign that UN treaty the day after the election, which is pretty troubling - in addition, he's also said that he supports the assault weapons ban, which is really, really troubling to most people with a passing knowledge of what that would actually mean.

Fair enough, you guys on the treaty call - I think I focused so much on the offensive timing of that move that I somehow spaced the small print. However, the only fact these talks are even moving forward at all is, per that article, the Obama administration.
The main reason the arms trade talks are taking place at all is that the United States - the world's biggest arms trader accounting for more than 40 percent of global conventional arms transfers - reversed U.S. policy on the issue after Obama was first elected and decided in 2009 to support a treaty.
I feel like it's disingenuous to represent yourself as an expert from the "other side."

Oh, in no ways am I an expert on "the other side." I would probably consider myself a SME on a few things, such as the nature of firearms and why assault weapons bans do not take that into consideration, but in general I'm just a person who is trying to point out that not everybody who disagrees is wearing devil horns.

Secession ala the American Civil War was a dumb idea in the 19th century, and it's a dumber idea in the 21st century where most states are purple and the major political divisions are urban/rural instead of regional. Assuming that the Robert E. Lee South (as opposed to the significant minority that makes up the Martin Luther King/Cesar Chavez South) did take up arms for independence, they'd lose the equivalent of the Western Campaign for the Mississippi and Sherman's March to the Sea from the start.

Texas is currently the one state whose secession efforts seem to be reaching 25,000 votes. So let's focus on them for a moment. 

With regards to Texas, this: 

corb: "This election has let them realize, once again, that it isn't enough - that their state will never, ever, have enough impact on the direction of the country in order for them to feel that they have adequate representation."

...is utter, unadulterated horseshit. 

There have been eleven Presidential elections since 1972. Care to take a guess how many times Texas has given their electoral votes to the winning candidate?

Eight. 

Out of Eleven. 

So let's recap: Texans have gotten their way in 73% or 3/4 of Presidential elections since 1972. 

They have representation, and plenty of it. They have 38 electoral votes, and a very vocal, powerful voice which has not only made a sizeable impact, but has actually helped choose which person became Commander in Chief in eight elections out of 11. 

The idea that they will "never, ever have enough impact on the direction of the country" is completely ludicrous.

corb: " (Actually, triple citizenship, but I don't think anywhere lets you do that.)"

My SO is citizen of three countries. She acquired the last after being naturalized here unless I'm misremembering the timeline. It's really hard to give up US citizenship. Even if you do all the "proper" stuff to renounce, the consular official can decide you were only doing it as part of a procedure required to get citizenship elsewhere and not accept the renouncement.

corb: "Well, he did sign that UN treaty the day after the election, which is pretty troubling - in addition, he's also said that he supports the assault weapons ban, which is really, really troubling to most people with a passing knowledge of what that would actually mean."

Funny how it's really troubling in one sentence but in the parenthetical the entire law is "ridiculous". I happen to agree it's ridiculous. I disagree that it is troubling, however, since it doesn't actually outlaw any weapons. Cut the pistol grip off and all of a sudden your AR-15 is just a plain old rifle. That's because it's a ridiculous and nonsensical law. It's far too ridiculous and nonsensical to be troubling. That said, I disagree with the Supreme Court's contention that the Second Amendment outlines an individual right that can be enforced against the states. The gun laws that work fine here in Oklahoma may not work so well for more dense places, and that's OK by me. The Second Amendment is vague enough that there's no real there there, so its interpretation is entirely up to ideology, which the present Court has in spades.

Regardless, Obama has yet to do anything to restrict firearms possession or ownership, yet you list it as one of the things that people might find concerning about a second term. Bizarre, that.

Ahem.

Caught an interesting bit on NPR this morning - one of their "we visit a small town and talk to people about shit" types of spots. They were in a diner and interviewing people who were grumbling about the partisan quality of debate, both in congress and during the election season. One woman opined that she wished Obama would go get a cocktail with Jon Boehner after work one night, they'd get a lot done just making nice like that.

But the interesting thing was, a number of the people they talked to were starting to realize "wait, this kind of is our fault." One of the people they talked to admitted he'd voted a straight Republican ticket, and only after the election did he realize that "wait, that one guy I voted for is really being a stuck-up stubborn guy and not cooperating with the rest of Congresss." He claimed that henceforward he's going to pay more attention to candidates as individuals. Antoher person they spoke to was talking about the vitriol she was seeing on Facebook among her friends after the election and she was thinking "well, no wonder Congress can't get it together, neither can the people who vote for them".

Honestly, people having those kinds of ephiphanies has me all happy.

"Oh, FFS. America, a nation formed by a secession, which enshrined in its founding documents the right of a people to alter or abolish a government that was not going very well. 

It is not un-American to thus want to alter or abolish or leave said government when it is not going well. It is, perhaps, un-American to keep people against their will.

Oh, FFS.

The right of people to alter or abolish a government is enshrined — we do it through elections. 

"Well, when he's also a president and a government that asserts the right to extrajudicially kill or indefinitely imprison US citizens, I think they have a very good case. I would certainly view that alone as a 10 on that scale. Attempting to remove the right of the people to keep and bear arms is probably about a 7. "

Actually, the signing statement he provided contradicts the claim that he's asserted it particularly, and the states that are represented by the secession petitions are all ones whose reps voted for the NDAA. As for attempting to remove the right of people to keep and bear arms — whose dubious individual locus is now grounded in a 5-4 decision — Obama's done nothing of the sort. It's rightwing bullshit to assert otherwise. 

"However, more realistically: states looking to secede are generally states where the Republican won by an enormous enormous margin. This election has let them realize, once again, that it isn't enough - that their state will never, ever, have enough impact on the direction of the country in order for them to feel that they have adequate representation.

Lack of adequate representation was in fact a large part of the reason for the secession of the Colonies. It could, in fact, be viewed as one of the greatest intolerable acts that can be committed - to rule a people without giving them a chance to contest that rule. "

They contested the election — they lost. And I'm not sure if you're just generally ignorant of U.S. history or whether your ideology is overwhelming your good sense here — especially since the reason they lost was largely because they lurched further rightward than the rest of the country. (And even still, they have, generally, GOP senators and Reps, and if they can't influence politics with those, they're morons.) 

"Yes, well, and we all know that violence brings the moral right, and so any outcome which has been decided by a war can never, ever be questioned. Especially not by peaceable means. After all, what would everyone have died for then?"

Oh, is this where your slavery apologia starts? 

" I'll give you that at least some of the people signing are probably just miffed because it's Obama, but I'm also seeing wide sharing of this in libertarian circles, and I will probably sign at least a few myself just to see what the Obama administration will answer/to support the right of people to peaceably leave. I think we just can't really know what the motivations of individuals are without knowing the individuals involved - even my own suggestions are just speculations. "

Supporting secession is treason. Sorry. It makes you a traitor to the country and to democracy. I recognize that literally nothing will come of this, but if I recall correctly, you swore an oath to uphold the constitution and laws of the U.S. and, perhaps because you haven't thought about this very much, you're about to sign a public document that gives the lie to those oaths. 

"Well, he did sign that UN treaty the day after the election, which is pretty troubling"

It's neither troubling nor true. 

"To present reasoned discourse from the other side and help good-faith individuals understand why people who are unlike themselves might make choices different from their own. Also to represent that there are, in fact, different opinions, and it's not just that everyone who differs is a nutjob. "

People who support secession are not necessarily nutjobs. They are traitors. That's not a different opinion any more than saying black people are inferior is a different opinion.

Any discussion of the Senate that doesn't begin and end with "the filibuster is being used by the Republican minority to cripple the Democrats, and, by extension, the country" is a joke. Reid did mention the fact that he's had to deal with over 200 filibusters while Lyndon Johnson had to deal with one, but the framing of the 60 Minutes piece was that if only the Democrats would compromise, the Senate could get things done. Why is the majority party the one that has to compromise when the minority has said their number one priority is to obstruct?

I guarantee I've read that document more times than you have, since, as you noted, I oathed to it. In addition, I've held a national security clearance during which process I talked for quite a long time about my political beliefs and still gained my clearance and was approved, because even the United States Government doesn't have your completely offensive ideas about what constitutes treason. (Which, you know, is a legal code that you are welcome to look up if you like.) You are welcome, as a citizen of the United States, to try every legal means you have to peaceably change or alter that government. The one thing you don't have is the right to take up arms against it or attempt to change it through illegal means. You may be confusing the two.

I guess what really irked me about the 60 Minutes segment was the inclusion of Olympia Snowe and Evan Bayh, two Senators who, as moderates in their parties, had more sway over legislation than anyone else in Congress. The 60th vote on any bill can basically name their price and get what they want -- calling her "President Snowe" was just barely an exaggeration. And Evan Bayh left the Senate to go make money as a lobbyist, not because it was too partisan.

Concerned that the new compact might not sufficiently safeguard states' rights, the anti-Federalists sought to insert into the New York ratification message language to the effect that "there should be reserved to the state of New York a right to withdraw herself from the union after a certain number of years."[29] The Federalists opposed this, with Hamilton, a delegate at the Convention, reading aloud in response a letter from James Madison stating: "the Constitution requires an adoption in toto, and for ever." Hamilton and John Jay then told the Convention that in their view, "a reservation of a right to withdraw [was] inconsistent with the Constitution, and was no ratification."[29] The Convention ultimately ratified the Constitution, without including the "right to withdraw" language proposed by the anti-Federalists.

I think this gets to my problem with the "we're just concerned about tyranny" crowd. There's no actual tyranny, but they connect the dots and extrapolate from these tiny data points to suggest that rounding up the guns and jailing dissenters is just around the corner. Meanwhile, these folks were conspicuously silent when the indefinite detention policies were instituted, when warrantless wiretapping of suspected terrorists was happening, etc. Maybe one or two people were were consistent from the beginning about this, but for a vast majority, concerns over Obama's policies are fig leaf to cover their distrust of a president they don't think is legitimate.

Er, Article Three.

Could you tell me where you are looking, Miko? The only point I could find relevant to klangklangston's claims is "Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies." I do understand that the right of secession is not enshrined in the Constitution, and accept that the federalists certainly did not believe in it and no right was passed, but I don't see that the absence of a right is a positive statement against said right. I do really appreciate your links, though!

You, in this very thread, implied that the Civil War should never have been fought, and that the blood and treasure expended in ending slavery - slavery, for crying out loud - was a waste. 

Yes, I think that the blood spent in subduing one half of the United States and turning brother against brother was absolutely a waste. The Civil War was one of the bloodiest wars we've taken part of, and the things we did during it (particularly in both side's POW camps and on Sherman's March to the South) were abominable. I think that the end of slavery could have been accomplished with less blood and less treasure. I am puzzled as to why this is somehow devil-horn worthy. Yes, we should have ended slavery, but I don't think I've heard anyone advocate (before, apparently, today) that we needed to kill people to do it or it somehow wasn't worthwhile.

Just to clarify, the argument being made here is that the Obama Administration expressing support for renewing the Assault Weapons Ban is equivalent to actually infringing on the right to bear arms?

More like "the consistent policies and stated intent show a willingness to infringe on the right to bear arms." The long process of gun control/gun rights fighting tends to move in the area of death-by-a-thousand-cuts, so there is rarely a Big Smoking Gun. I would consider a reinstatement of the Assault Weapons Ban as infringing on gun rights, though.

The Civil War was one of the bloodiest wars we've taken part of, and the things we did during it (particularly in both side's POW camps and on Sherman's March to the South) were abominable.

Everyone agrees with this. This is the new, reasoned perspective from the "other side"? Can we have a new representative, please?

Could you tell me where you are looking, Miko? The only point I could find relevant to klangklangston's claims is "Treason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies." I do understand that the right of secession is not enshrined in the Constitution, and accept that the federalists certainly did not believe in it and no right was passed, but I don't see that the absence of a right is a positive statement against said right. 

If you advocate secession, you are adhering to the enemies of the United States.

I don't see that the absence of a right is a positive statement against said right

That's the way the Constitution works. First, we do know it was intentionally excluded. But second, if a right was overlooked or originally not debated (which of course isn't the case here, but if) then the process for changing it would be by Constitutional amendment - not by secession, which by definition in Article 3 (as upheld by Texas v. White,) is an act of treason.

No, the problem would still exist, but instead it would go unchallenged. Personally, I think that's worse. 

As Brandon said, this election was close in part because one side was selling a pack of lies to their constituents, and those constituents were not hearing the truth. So many people took those lies to be true that they're now not only completely shocked their guy lost, but they're branding people who voted for the other guy scumbags and traitors. 

This is what happens when you ignore lies. People tacitly assume they are true, and they in turn perpetuate. In 2008, 16% of Republicans thought President Obama was Muslim. This year, a study revealed that number had nearly doubled: 30% of Republicans thought he was Muslim. 

Sorry, but no. Cortex did the right thing by telling her to walk away, and we did the right thing by challenging her. She's spreading outright lies that are easily countered with facts. Best that not be ignored.

There is something here about not really getting that this is a democracy, and that means the other parties get to run candidates in elections and you can actually lose if more people vote for them. (Entitlement something something something?)

The Republicans will continue their factional infighting and finger-pointing, and it's probably going to get even worse. They'll come up with a plan to retake the Senate in 2014, or more likely, different conflicting plans for their faction to retake control of their party and congress. We'll see how that goes.

You know, there's something I've been struggling to articulate for a really long time. It seems to me that even much, if not all of the "non-Western" world, agrees that a national government's job includes ensuring universal education, universal healthcare, etc. That the developing world doesn't do this very well (for values of "not very well" ranging from "pretty good" to "there's supposed to be a system here?") doesn't change the fundamental understanding that failing to provide these things is a failure of government. Granted, notions of personal freedom vary tremendously around the world, but I'm talking about the perception of citizens about the responsibility of government vis a vis social welfare. The US strikes me as really unusual in the proportion of the citizenry that rejects this basic premise that seems self-evident to much (really I think it's most) of the rest of the world.

this election was close in part because one side was selling a pack of lies to their constituents, and those constituents were not hearing the truth.

I think it's important to keep in mind that MANY of those constituents had/have absolutely no interest in hearing the truth. They don't want their worldviews or beliefs or biases and prejudices challenged in any way, they only want them confirmed. 

The willful ignorance I've encountered in the past year engaging people on political topics is astonishing. I'm from the deep south and live in California's Bible belt, so I have a lot of opportunity to have these kinds of conversations with people whose worldviews are quite different from mine, and I'm actually pretty good at having them in a very civil and respectful way. I am so dismayed at how many otherwise smart, thoughtful adults are acting like children when it comes to hearing facts that disagree with how they want the world to be. 

Confirmation bias is a pretty strong tendency in human beings generally (as is the avoidance of cognitive dissonance), but so many Americans right now simply want their worldview confirmed and never challenged, and Fox News et al is like heroin to them. 

I think it is wrong to blame conservative media as specifically responsible: they are selling a product to lots of people eager to consume it. Epistemic closure is not forced upon an individual or group; it is chosen, sought out, and eagerly practiced. Anyone who doesn't know that Fox News or any far right "conservative" talking head, pundit, or blogger is disconnected from reality in verifiable, factual ways is willfully ignorant. No literate adult with access to the internet in the 21st century can plausibly claim ignorance, I'm sorry. People need to start taking responsibility (and being held more responsible for) the ideas in their heads. Fox News can't put a bad idea in your head if you don't let them.

I do understand that the right of secession is not enshrined in the Constitution, and accept that the federalists certainly did not believe in it and no right was passed, but I don't see that the absence of a right is a positive statement against said right.

The Constitution itself by its existence prohibits secession. The original constitution of the United States was the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union. The Constitution was enacted to form "a more perfect union". From Texas v White:
It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made more perfect, is not?
Abraham Lincoln made the same argument in his first inaugural address, before the Civil War:
The Union is much older than the Constitution. It was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was further matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union.

ess you believe all foreign nations are enemies of the US, which would be a dumb thing to think, that's not true at all.

On what are you basing that? The Article pertains to American citizens, people living under the Constitution, not foreign nationals. It's impossible to be treasonous against a nation you are not part of constitutionally. 

Advocating peaceful, legally-achieved secession might be weapons-grade stupid, but it is not treasonous. In the absence of someone making war against the US, it is virtually impossible for any action to be treasonous.

The advocating for secession is just seditious. But there are a lot of ways short of war to be treasonous: revealing state secrets to a foreign power unauthorized, advocating armed war against the US like Axis Sally and Tokyo Rose (later pardoned because of witness tampering); defecting. 

I mean it's pretty extreme and somewhat hyperbolic to run around accusing people of treason and sedition. But if there were a serious extralegal secession attempt, then I suspect that would be a time in which those accusations would be reasonably entertained.

Not really wanting to defend corb here, but from my Canadian perspective, Texas strikes me as America's Quebec -- a state that will always be unique in terms of how it plays with all the others. Different history, different myths, a large and valuable disproportionately powerful chunk of real estate. 

So up here, the Quebec Question is pretty much always in play. Will they or won't they Separate? No one ever says secede. There have been two referendums on Quebec in my lifetime ... and both have failed. The people of Quebec have put it to a vote and rejected it. Which, to me, strengthens their position within the country. As opposed to the one time that federal military force was used (the so-called Quebec Crisis of 1970), which only strengthened the Separatists in the long run. 

But yeah, if I was American, I'd say, "Hey Texas, you want to Separate, become Mexico's 32nd State (I'm sure they'd love to have you), refute all that Remember The Alamo foo-for-ah? Get to it. Because you're boring the hell out of me."

The U.S. repeatedly picked fights with neighbors, and almost always won territory by doing so.

... in fact they [Texans, for example] have the same degree of representation as every other American voter ...

Actually one of the cool things about this election is we have better models than ever before for how unfair our elections are. This is the problem of "voting power" -- "the probability that a single vote is decisive in the election."

We all know that voters in some states matter more than others -- that's what "swing states" are about. "Voting power" is basically a way to put a mathematical estimate on the relative importance of each voter. But as this paper explains, it's quite difficult to accurately measure voting power in a complex system like the Electoral College -- you end up needing to run simulations based on a behavioral model of all the actual voters in the system.

Turns out that a certain someone has been publishing the results of his behavioral model of the Electoral College all year! If you scroll down a bit you can find Nate Silver's "Return on Investment Index" over on the right, which is his phrase for voting power. For the first time (outside of high-level campaign strategy meetings) we have daily updates on voting power in each state.

And the results are pretty shocking, I think. For example, voting power in Ohio is 11.8. Voting power in the least important 38 states is 0.1 or less. So that means that persuading one voter in Ohio has a greater impact on the likely outcome of the election than persuading 118 voters in an average state. Three days of voter outreach in Ohio outweighs a year in Massachusetts or Texas. (Or maybe you could think of it as a popular-vote election where Ohioans each get 118 votes? Not sure about that one.)

None of this is exactly new, but it's a clearer picture of our disenfranchisement than we've had before. There's a fine line between having 1/118 of a vote and none at all.

On what are you basing that?

It is logically possible for a state to secede but not go to war against the US, so the seceding state would not be an enemy of the US. Merely becoming foreign would not make a state an enemy, any more than the Philippines became the enemy of the US when they ceased being an American possession. Making war against the US makes one an enemy, not foreignness.

But there are a lot of ways short of war to be treasonous

There are not. It would be virtually impossible to be convicted of treason against the US in the absence of somebody making war against it. Yes, it is possible to be convicted of treason without personally firing a shot at Americans, but it is ~impossible to be convicted of treason if you are not part of a nation or organization that is making war. Unless there is a war on at the time, it is ~impossible to be convicted of treason.

I'm not planning to die on this hill because it's mostly an abstract thing. Very few people have ever been convicted for it. But it's not the smallest thing to seriously propose secession; it's ridiculous, but shouldn't be treated as part of the normal course of affairs.

I'm bearish on Haley's prospects.

In the wake of Sanford's trail-hiking Haley rode to office on the back of the Tea Party and Sarah Palin (who campaigned for her) and still only beat her Democratic opponent by 4 points. So in the absence of similar circumstances, Haley's chances of being a Presidential candidate seem pretty slim and her VP chances only slightly higher. I think it's unlikely that the national media would overlook the allegations of financial and romantic improprieties that will probably continue to follow her and she's presided over only a few successes in her term and more than a few embarrassments, most recently a cyber attack on the Dept of Rev and the loss of over 3 million social security numbers. She's widely tolerated but not wildly admired, so at this point I don't think she has a lot to offer on the national stage.

This is what I keep failing to find in the Article. There doesn't have to be an enemy to "levy war." If you decide to take up arms against a government power, you're levying war, committing treason. You don't have to be aligned with anyone. There's an "or" in the clause.

Sure. But advocacy of peaceful secession doesn't levy war, so that part doesn't matter to the advocacy of peaceful secession. I mean, fine, the federal government is free to assert that it does, in the same way that it's free to assert that I'm actually a kumquat. But that assertion would not get very far in a grand jury or court.

I'm not planning to die on this hill because it's mostly an abstract thing. Very few people have ever been convicted for it.

And I'm not aware of anyone ever convicted of treason for acts unrelated to an actual war against the US. Which is my point. If there is no war for it to be related to, if no actual enemy exists, then advocacy, propaganda, or other speech can't be treason against the US.

And I'm not aware of anyone ever convicted of treason for acts unrelated to an actual war against the US.

The Whiskey Rebellion is a really good example of a domestic insurrection found to be 'levying war' against the government. 

The wording of the clause allows the federal government to construct a definition of "levy war' as an act that an individual or group can perform in opposition to the state, without the involvement of an enemy state or a pre-existing active war between declared combatants.

It just doesn't seem like you have a strong legal argument about treason here, in demanding that only allying with a foreign enemy can make you treasonous.

You're confusing me with someone who said that.

What I said was that you can't be convicted of treason in the absence of any war against the US. This is, as far as I can tell, true, and it would mean that advocacy of peaceful and legal secession wouldn't be treasonous.

If there's no war against the US, then you can't be levying war against the US. Because if you were levying war, there would be war.

And if there's no war against the US, whether foreigners or putative Americans engaged in rebellion, you don't have an enemy to adhere to, so you can't commit treason.

The Whiskey Rebellion is a really good example of a domestic insurrection found to be 'levying war' against the government.

Aren't you agreeing with me here? The Whiskey Rebellion was a war against the US. A very small and hopelessly one-sided one, but still an armed rebellion. Which is a kind of a war.

Not so sure about the European support. Britain certainly could have ended up supporting the CSA.

English support for the CSA would have been weak and short-lived for multiple reasons: dependence on Union grain imports, abolitionist sentiment, and the horrifying casualty counts and documentary photography come to mind. 

And France? Napoleon III was a few bad years away from being unseated in a revolution. 

I don't think that European support would have been stable enough or sufficient to maintain a peace between the Union and the CSA over multiple decades of hostility.

You keep saying this --- but where are you getting it? Where are you reading that there must be a condition of war against the US in order to qualify an act as treason? The act of treason may itself initiate the war, and constitute a "levying" of war, but a condition of war doesn't seem to need to be pre-existing.

Just wanted to float something out there regarding the argument that all those Red Staters don't feel represented... 

Regarding the Senate: 

There where 24 states that voted for Romney this year --- 48 Senate seats --- Those 48 state represent just over 1/3 of the total of the population of all 50 states (lets exclude DC, because hey why should we included about 600 thousand disenfranchised citizens in a hissy fit about conservative representation). Ok... 1/3 of the population has nearly 1/2 of the Senate representation!

ooooh, not represented at the Federal government, oooh. There is a strong argument these States are OVER represented. 

now, I don't mind that, I think the Senate as balanced by the house is well thought out. 

Combine it with the fact that "blues states" hold about a 122 advantage in House seats, but somehow the Republicans still maintain control of the House because of gerrymandering, THAT I do mind. Conservatives who complain about under representation because their rick lying ass corporate candidate lost by a few % points can stick it up their ass and light it on fire... Talk about entitlement seriously.

I have a modest proposal: Republican reservations, with limited sovereignty. 

No casinos though. And Native Americans get back the land vacated by Republicans in the rest of America. 

(Honestly, I do keep thinking about what happens to Indian reservations in a state thate secedes. Sovereignty established under treaty with the United States depends on being *in* the United States. In my view, the federal government might be treaty bound to defend those reservations militarily. Since a number of the "we wanna secede" states have numerous reservations within them, how is that going to work? Even Texas, where settler colonial genocide was uniquely ruthless and effective, has two reservations within its borders. They are sovereign nations full of dual citizens. 

And many of them are pretty good with a gun, by the way.

IN WHICH CASE THERE WOULD BE A WAR, WOULD THERE NOT?

But without a foreign enemy, which you seem to keep saying is a necessary condition.

I never said that. I just said that there had to be a war for there to be treason.

You said that advocating secession is adhering to the enemies of the US. That's not true, because it would be entirely possible for the seceded state to be a foreign country that is not an enemy of the US.

If I advocate the peaceful secession of Texas, to be achieved in some way the US views as legal, and it comes about, and there is no war about it... how can I have committed treason? I haven't levied any war against the US, nor have I aided her enemies. I've aided what is now a foreign country, to be sure, but that isn't treasonous. For God's sake, the hypothesis even assumes that in some way my actions have been actively sanctioned by the US.

From the Daily Caller: White House deluged with secession petitions from 20 states.

Well, this makes sense to me. Once you realize that every potential Canada that you might flee to is more socialist than the U.S.A., this is the only other option left. I mean, besides "sucking it up."

In regards to how much your vote counts, this once again plays into the belief that the presidential election is the only one that matters. We have Senators, Representatives, Governors and a whole bevy of state, city and county level elected officials who have much more impact on our lives than the President. 

Yes, great, Obama won. But we better have the state houses and senates filled with not insane people by the time the next redistricting period roles around or we're looking at gerrymandering favored districts for Republicans (and, yes, in some cases Democrats) for another decade. Less insane people in state government means less insane state laws.

This belief that the presidency is the only thing that matters (and I'm not saying that that is what is being expressed here, but jeez, the "got to get out of my solidly red state now before I have to gay marry a black person" bullshit suggests a certain belief that the presidency is all that matters) is a huge part of the problem.

An act of Congress that removes a state from the Union is conceivable and would not be treason, yes.

That would not be secession, however, which is a state declaring itself no longer part of the U.S. Secession is considered an act of rebellion in defiance of U.S. law.

Such an act of Congress would be, well, Experialism, rather than secession. Which is theoretically legal, although it would probably take an amendment to the Constitution to do it.

I mean, I could certainly see where they might claim it, but the federal government does not treat reservations well under the current system. A case might be made that states might treat First Nations tribes better than the federal one does. 

This is all speculation, though if memory serves there was an interesting alternate-history story where the Confederacy allied with the Native Americans and a third nation was formed. Sadly I am blanking on the title.

Prediction Market Manipulation: A Case Study from 7 NOV:
If one really wants to manipulate a market, it has to be done by placing large orders that serve as price ceilings and floors, and to do this across complementary contracts in a consistent way.

As it happens, this is exactly what someone tried to do yesterday. At around 3:30 pm, I noticed that the order book for both Obama and Romney contracts on Intrade had become unusually asymmetric, with a large block of buy orders for Romney in the 28-30 range, and a corresponding block of sell orders for Obama in the 70-72 range.

Where even the most timid of Gun Control is pretty much a failed issue, but still used to scare people. Where Climate Change is a settled issue everywhere except in politics and public opinion, where evolution is STILL hotly contested, candidates advocate for the gold standard and elimination of paper currency with a straight face, where Unions are evil but Multinational corporations are models of near citizenship, where we have to settle for profit driven, insurance company run, healthcare as the nearest we can come to some almost sane national healthy care policy. Where guns are more important than carbon reduction

Well, from the Inquirer.

Some Philadelphia neighborhoods outdid themselves in Tuesday's presidential election.

In a city where President Obama received more than 85 percent of the votes, in some places he received almost every one. In 13 Philadelphia wards, Obama received 99 percent of the vote or more.

Those numbers are not really as shocking as they sound. I'm sure you could find similar numbers for Romney in heavily red areas. Romney lost by almost 300,000 votes in PA, if there is fraud that massive, you aren't going to be able to hide it.

Despite the snark, this is a (mostly) decent post - particularly on the issues of debt and science and such. Some things I strongly disagree with, but some points are fair. This is, though, one of the major problems with a two-party system. Each party can get away with doing things that are egregiously against what the party faithful want or believe. Republicans may not like debt and Dems might not like wars and civil liberty violations - but as it stands, they're stuck. 

The real change seems mostly to happen on state lines. So for example, you get deep-South Democrats who oppose abortion, and New York Republicans that march in gay pride parades and legalize gay marriage. I'm not sure why it can't seem to spread, but that's where I put my hope, anyway.

PA does not have same day registration. Here is the deal, there were 59 voting divisions in Philly (NOT counties) where Romney got no votes. (Gary Johnson did though, lol) There are 1,687 divisions in total. This was a tiny subset of the city, representing not enough votes to swing the election.

If this was fraud, voter ID would have nothing to do with it. They would have had to eliminate Romney votes.

Here, look at this. Even a newspaper can't track down the Republicans in these divisions.

Take North Philadelphia's 28th Ward, third division, bounded by York, 24th, and 28th Streets and Susquehanna Avenue.

About 94 percent of the 633 people who live in that division are black. Seven white residents were counted in the 2010 census.

In the entire 28th Ward, Romney received only 34 votes to Obama's 5,920.

Although voter registration lists, which often contain outdated information, show 12 Republicans live in the ward's third division, The Inquirer was unable to find any of them by calling or visiting their homes.

If Republicans want to win there, maybe they should move there.

Calling their bluff on secession

A MeFite had a similar question on Facebook, where there was actual graphic that said all the registered voters in Cuyahoga County, Ohio voted for Obama. A quick look at the election results, from the Ohio Secretary of State website, showed this was not true. 

The graphic actually exaggerates something unusual that did happen in Cuyahoga and has been commented on by a number of right wing blogs -- namely that there were seventeen precincts within that county that did not register a single vote for Romney. Of those, nine went unanimously to Obama, an impressive accomplishment. 
Barack Obama dominated many portions of Cuyahoga County with better than 80 percent of the vote, but he also won some precincts in cities from Bay Village to Solon.

The vote, incredibly, was unanimous in Obama's favor in nine Cleveland precincts.

The largest of those voted 542-0 in favor of Obama. In seven other Cleveland precincts and one in East Cleveland, Romney didn't pick up a single vote, though votes for third-party candidates stopped the president short of unanimous victories.

On Cleveland's West Side, Obama won 76 percent. And he carried 69 percent countywide.

In the suburbs, Obama won 62 percent of the vote. This was helped, in part, by winning 98 percent in both Warrensville Heights and East Cleveland, but those towns and Cleveland alone did not provide the countywide margin.

Cities where Obama won every precinct stretched from Lakewood and Brook Park to Cleveland Heights and Orange.

Meanwhile, the only citywide precinct sweeps for Romney were in Brecksville, Highland Heights and Independence, though Romney also did so in a handful of villages on the eastern side of the county.

....

So put altogether, how important was Cleveland and the rest of Cuyahoga County in the 2012 election?

The unofficial tally shows that Obama won Cuyahoga County by 236,478 votes.

In Ohio's other 87 counties combined, Romney won by 129,219 votes.

In other words, without Cuyahoga County, Romney was the winner in Ohio.
Interesting story. Stupid graphic.

I think it could easily turn into a holiday like a cross between Super Bowl Sunday and the 4th of July. People on my block were setting off fireworks right after NBC called it for Obama. It's already a major TV-watching and socializing event in homes and at bars. All it needs is some kind of traditional post-voting activity, like you vote and then you go out for coffee. And coffee shops and restaurants can have Voter Specials for those wearing their "I Voted" stickers.

Going out to the new DFL leadership as soon as they take office:
To: the DFL leadership and the representatives of my home district

First of all congratulations. To those who ran and won this year congratulations for your wins and in the larger context congratulations for the DFL retaking the Minnesota legislature. As arduous as it may have been for some of you it can truly be said the most difficult part lies ahead. The budget, job creation, tax overhaul, LGA, Health and Human Services, education, environmental issues, all these things are terribly important issues I am sure the DFL and Governor Dayton will wrestle with over the next two years. As benefits someone who is politically active and takes a keen interest in the State I live in I have strong feeling about all these issues. However, today, I am writing with not only a plea on something not listed above, but a small piece of advice I hope is well received and which is at least taken seriously.

As you are well aware the last election saw the defeat of two Amendments, I am thankful for those defeats, they made me proud to be a Minnesotan. I wish to put it to you however, that the DFL takeover of the legislature may well owe no small debt to the incredible voter turn out to defeat the Constitutional ban on Marriage Equality, and the Voter ID bill. In an election year that saw the DFL win most close races state wide, those that turned out to specifically vote against those Amendments could well have spelled the difference between a divided legislature, or even a continuation of the Republican legislature, and how it turned out. I worked as an election judge here in Duluth on election day, and at my precinct of about 2300 voters I registered 419 new voters on election day, that was about a 20% increase. The majority of those voters where young, and insofar as it is possible to tell, they where fired up for one reason, to defeat those Amendments, each one of you benefited directly from this. 

Now, I fully realize the temptation to move cautiously on the issue of Marriage Equality. Despite the Amendment's defeat it still remains a divisive issue. There are literally millions of people in the State of Minnesota that oppose it. I sympathize with the position each of you may be in. But, I urge each of you to consider tackling the issue of legalizing marriage equality sooner than later, not only from the point of view of someone who cares about the issue, not only from the point of view that in a sense I feel the DFL owes a certain potion of gratitude and debt to those people who helped not only defeat the Amendment, but elect you back to the majority at the same time, but... because I think it makes strategic electoral good sense as well. The Amendment defeat cries out for some action from the legislature, to ignore it completely in the next session would not only be tone-deaf but risk alienating a lot of the 2012 first time voters come 2014. To delay addressing it, as may be the natural inclination, until late in the session you run the real risk of invigorating and mobilizing all those voters who oppose such progress. The solution, I put to you, is to address it straightaway. Pass a marriage equality bill, if not the first thing then within short order. The longer marriage equality is the norm the longer people will have to get use to it. The longer people get use to it, the harder it will be to mobilize against it, and those that voted for it. The harder it is to mobilize against it the more secure your seats will be. 

It is literally not only the moral thing to do but the electoral smart thing to do as well.


Thank you for your time and service to the State:

Nope. It was taken away from the governor in 2004 when then Gov. Romney was primed to appoint a Republican senator to replace Kerry in the senate during his presidential run. The appropriate legislation was passed with a veto-proof majority.

Since then vacancies in MA are filled via a special election.

The Awakening: Why white nationalists are thrilled with Obama's victory
posted by homunculus at 10:58 PM on November 12, 2012 [1 favorite]


CA to GOP: Adios
Assuming the leaders in the few remaining close races hold their leads, there will be 38 Democrats and 15 Republicans representing California in Congress come January. Of those 38 Democrats, 18 are women, nine are Latinos, five are Asian Americans, three are African Americans, four are Jews and at least one is gay. Just 12 are white men. Of the 15 Republicans, on the other hand, all are white men — not a woman, let alone a member of a racial minority or a Jew, among them.

The composition of the state's new Democratic congressional delegation merely reflects the state's demographic changes. Latinos (72% of whom backed Obama) were 23% of the California electorate in 2012, up from 18% in 2008. The share of Asian voters (who voted for Obama at a 79% rate) doubled, from 6% to 12%, between those two elections. Voters under 30 increased their share of state ballots cast from 20% in 2008 to 27% in 2012, and backed Obama at a 71% rate. The state's proportion of white voters, meanwhile, fell from 65% in 2004 to 63% in 2008 to just 55% last week.

More sentient Republicans now say the party needs to modify its position on immigration. But a deeper look into the politics of the increasingly young and multicolored electorate suggests that the GOP is estranged from this new America on more issues than just immigration. The exit polling on Proposition 30, the tax hike on the wealthy promoted by Gov. Jerry Brown to keep the state's schools and universities from further disastrous budget cuts, shows key elements of the Democrats' new majority consigning the old Howard-Jarvis-no-tax-hike California to history's dustbin. Voters under 30 supported Proposition 30 at a 67% rate, and Asian Americans gave it 61% support.

at my precinct of about 2300 voters I registered 419 new voters on election day, that was about a 20% increase.

Part of me thinks that's a misleading number. I mean, I (re-)registered on Election Day as somehow my name was permuted on the voter roll. That's (hopefully) rare, but same-day registration means that people are a bit lazy about updating their registration when they move. (Motor voter should solve this for people with driver's licenses or state ID, but people are bad about changing their license when they move. And, of course, we know plenty of people don't have those.) Minnesota removes you from the voter roll after four years of inactivity. It's not clear to me if people who only vote in presidential elections get purged every time, but, if they do, they're probably a big same-day registration demographic.

corb, you are misinformed. Under the Obama administration the federal government has taken Native sovereignty quite seriously.

Let me be clear: I don't think any President since perhaps Jefferson has really taken tribal sovereignty seriously. I don't think Obama is worse than many other presidents on tribal sovereignty. I don't think that Romney would have been better on tribal sovereignty. But I think the standard many are judging by is one that does not accept full sovereignty. Full sovereignty cannot be given at a whim, by pleasure. Full sovereignty must be enshrined on the whole, as a right.

The Keystone XL Pipeline project and approval process showed how treaties are routinely violated even under an Obama administration. ( People were also arrested, on Lakota land, for attempting to block the trucks from entering against tribal wishes.) That's not to mention:
-Social services is still taking children from native parents and fostering them outside the tribe
-The Federal Government still practices extremely offensive practices for determining who is Native and entitled to protections as such. 
-The Federal Government still refuses to recognize many tribes, even when states do, which means, again, many are left without protection. 
-Tribal police are prohibited from arresting non-natives on tribal land, which, among other things, is leading to a domestic violence epidemic. 
-They are not allowed to act on an international level or coin money. Federal laws still apply to them, and they still have to pay federal income tax

Man, I'm getting depressed just listing stuff off. But essentially, no, Native sovereignty hasn't been taken seriously for a long, long time. Obama may be slightly better, but that is just not enough.

And then you can all come back once Latinos have taken over the joint to help deliver even bigger Blue majorities.

In the alternative, you can remain a part of America, respect this thing called "democracy," and brace yourself like you've never braced yourself. Because Texas is going to look like California some day. And that day is coming up fast.

Previous post:

>>It's worth noting that so far Citizens United has simply enabled rich assholes to waste a lot more money

>I'll point out (again) that the approx. $1 billion in dark money, 81% of which went to Republicans, may well have stopped Obama from reaching 400 EVs, the Senate from gaining 2, 3, 5 or some other number more Ds, and the House from swinging D or at least a lot closer to it.

There seems to be something of a consensus developing that, "Well, we really dodged a bullet with Citizens United. All that private money doesn't really make much difference at all in elections. Democracy wins!"

Besides the obvious point I made above--that if you subtracted the $1 billion plus in Dark Money, Democrats may have done MUCH better than they did--I'd like to make a less obvious point:

The Dark Money enabled the Republican Party to get its 47% of the vote with far more extreme policy positions than they could have maintained absent the Dark Money.

The equations go something like this:

- With Dark Money: More extreme positions + $800 million of Dark Money spent convincing people that "extreme positions are really super good!" + $1 billion of own money = 47% of the vote

- Without Dark Money Possibility #1: More extreme positions (as above) + $1 billion of own money = 35-40% of the vote

- Without Dark Money Possibility #2: More moderate positions + $1 billion of own money = 47% of the vote

The basic idea is that money allows you to recruit, convince, motivate, and gather votes even with extreme policy positions that are not naturally that attractive.

Absent that money, you have to change your policy positions to those more naturally attractive to voters. If you don't have the money to do the work of gathering more votes, you have to do it in policy change instead.

50% is winner take all, so parties have a strong drive towards that percentage. The fact that Rs received 47% of the vote allows party hacks to argue that they are still basically on the right track--things just need to be tweaked a bit.

If they'd had a shellacking in the 30-40% range, they'd be singing a far different tune.

The different between narrow loss and shellacking is exactly that Dark Money.

Or in other words: The immediate result of Dark Money in elections is a mainstreaming of radical and extreme positions.

We didn't dodge that bullet. It was fired this election and it hit us square between the eyes.

Apologies for interupting the Atlas Shruggathon . . . 

The immediate result of Dark Money in elections is a mainstreaming of radical and extreme positions.

Here are a few more thoughts about what makes this dynamic work:

- $800 million buys A LOT of advertising in the swing states, and like it or not, that advertising does attract votes. So the Republicans adopt positions that would get them only (say) 42% of the vote but this additional advertisement and outreach gains them (say) 5% more in votes and enthusiasm.

This is more important than it looks because if the Rs were polling in the high 30s to low 40s they would realize they were in a very bad losing position. They would be scrambling to change anything and everything needed to get back into contention. But with the Dark Money artificially bringing their support up to the high 40s, it looks like they are in striking distance and all they need is a little more tweaking to pull it off.

In short, the Dark Money reduces the party's incentive to change what are otherwise losing policies and strategies. 

- Of course Dark Money might also move losing positions or candidates, who would naturally gain only 45% of the vote, into a winning position with 50% of the vote. I think we all realize that possibility, however. What we may not realize is the radicalizing effect: To gain that extra 5% of the vote 'naturally' would likely require some compromise or re-tooling of the policy to garner additional support. The Dark Money allows that position to power straight on through in more radicalized form.

- More directly, large single donors kept a number of the Republican primary candidates in the race long after they would naturally have dropped out. The large donors do this because they want to prop up support for their pet policies, and they succeed. Many months that Romney would have liked to have spent driving to the center he was forced to spend driving even further to the right--and that can basically all be chalked up to Dark Money's effect on the Republican Primary.

- We've previously mentioned the strong influence of Dark Money on local and statewide races. One result there has been a polarization of state legislatures and as a result, these gerrymandered Congressional Districts.

Gerrymandered Congressional Districts are a lot of bad things, but one of those is safe districts for either Ds or Rs. This allows more extreme candidates--from both sides--to be elected in these districts than would be possible if the districts were less one-sided.

To summarize: Dark Money allows a more radical agenda to win or, short of winning, remain viable when it would naturally die on the vine.

Dark Money is the primary reason we still have a Republican Party pursuing a 1980s strategy.

Absent the Dark Money Republicans would haven been forced to face the 21st Century reality and changing demographics much sooner. And that would be good for the Republican Party and good for America.

Yeah, the comments about money not affecting the election are mostly just post-election relief. I don't think anyone really misunderstands the effect the money had in terms of allowing both the Republicans and Democrats to run the kinds of campaigns they did.

New York Times: Democrats Like a Romney Idea on Income Tax. Excerpt:
The proposal by Mr. Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, was envisioned to help pay for an across-the-board income tax cut, a move ridiculed by President Obama as window dressing to a “sketchy deal.” But many Democrats now see it as an important element of a potential deficit reduction agreement — and one they can claim to be bipartisan.

The cap — never fully detailed by Mr. Romney — is similar to a longstanding proposal by Mr. Obama to limit income tax deductions to 28 percent, even for affluent households that pay a 35 percent rate. But a firm cap of around $35,000 would hit the affluent even harder than Mr. Obama’s proposal, which has previously gotten nowhere in Congress.

“Let’s just say there’s a renewed interest,” said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “Part of it is people reflecting on Obama’s proposal, but when Romney said what he said, it just added fuel.”

“I was a little surprised Romney proposed a dollar cap when he did it,” Mr. Conrad added.

The attention on the plan is evidence that ideas on deficit reduction are beginning to take firmer form as the January deadline for dealing with expiring tax cuts and automatic spending reductions draws close. The lame-duck session that begins Tuesday could be one of the most pivotal in years, and the political atmosphere is considerably different than when lawmakers left in October for the fall campaigns.

We need to stop being simplistic, we need to trust the intelligence of the American people and we need to stop insulting the intelligence of the voters.”

Jindal, 02/09 in what was his first widely-televised appearance as a leading voice in national conservatism:

"something called 'volcano monitoring'... Instead of monitoring volcanoes, what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington"

Jindal, 04/09, after the eruption of Mount Redoubt:

And then, to drive the point home: Mount Eyjafjallajökull erupts in 2010, causing massive disruptions across Europe.

Looks like Paul Ryan is flexing his muscles, testing his strength. From Talking Points Memo:
Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA) and Tom Price (GA) will go head-to-head Wednesday afternoon as the members hold a closed-door vote to elect the next House Republican Conference Chairman, the party’s No. 4 leadership role.

Speaker John Boehner is officially neutral but privately supporting McMorris Rodgers. Paul Ryan, the returning chairman of the Budget Committee whose profile rose enormously during his vice presidential run, is asking colleagues to back Price.
[...]
On Tuesday morning, Ryan sent out a “dear colleague” letter building support for Price: “I am asking you to join me in supporting Congressman Tom Price to be our next Chairman of the House Republican Conference,” he wrote, calling Price “uniquely qualified for the job” and noting that he was “instrumental in drafting our House Republican budget.”

“No one will work harder than Congressman Price at building a strong and compelling communications and policy strategy that reflects the will of our membership and the needs of the nation,” Ryan wrote.

syzygy: I didn't think it was that bad. The 'Third Way' document does say in the 'balance the budget' section that Republicans need to accept a tax increase and Brooks mentions trimming the annual $1.1 trillion in tax loopholes, many of which go to corporations and the rich.

The wealthiest Americans, like Romney, seem to pay a very low tax rate (<15%) compared to the middle class; yet, the upper bracket income tax rates are quite high. It should be possible to to fix the regressive taxation without adjusting the rates themselves - if that is the best way to negotiate a deal. There are probably problems with corporate and small business taxes, as Republicans are constantly pointing out, that could be fixed without cutting taxes and possibly increasing them on very high profits.

Anyway, I think the dems should work hard to avoid a big confrontation and negotiate a good deal on taxes/budget cuts. If the GOP won't budge, then obviously they have to go to war. But that could go very badly for the dems - especially if the economy crashes. The economy hasn't been looking that good lately, and Obama can't pass any new laws without the House.

I wonder if the GOP will even try to negotiate in good faith; it will be interesting to see what happens. I hope they do.

According to Raw Story Ryan did not learn a damn thing from the election; after saying that Romney/Ryan lost because lots of urban voters showed up.
Ryan added that it was “disappointing” because “losing never feels good,” but insisted that the race had not been a referendum on his budget plan, which would have slashed the size of government and turned Medicare into a voucher program.

“I don’t think we lost it on those budget issues, especially on Medicare,” the former nominee explained. “We clearly didn’t lose it on those issues. I think what people want us to do is tackle the country’s problems, and what I got out of this is they don’t want only Republican ideas or only Democratic ideas, they want us to come together for common ground and to work this out.”

Although exit polls showed that six in ten voters wanted tax rates to be raised, Ryan said he didn’t believe that was what Americans really voted for.
I think the GOP is planning on pretending that since they are still a majority in the house that means they have a mandate from the American People not to raise taxes.

A return to Clinton-era rates should be non-negotiable because it was something Obama specifically campaigned on, and he won the election.

It's way too easy to hide the ball when you're closing loopholes and limiting deductions, but the rates are the rates. The GOP is never going to hand over anything significant on raising corporate tax rates or estate taxes, and they have no leverage on spending because the sequestered cuts are already out there, so there's no reason to give them extension of the Bush cuts after the first 250k of income.

Don't get me wrong -- simplifying the tax code and limiting loopholes is important, but there is no reason to give up something Obama promised to do in Every. Single. Stump speech.

There's no such thing as a "mandate" in my mind. The election is over. All there is, really, are politicians doing their job running the country, or not, and the 2014/2016 elections. The fact is the Republicans still own the House and can block the Senate. So they will decide what to do based on how they think it will help them in the next election and, hopefully, what they think is best for the country. If they are instead making decisions based on a "mandate," they are making a strategic mistake, imo. Same thing goes for Obama.

Golden Eternity: I didn't think it was that bad.

I disagree. It is another in an series of articles and/or statements from the right suggesting that the president and the Democrats must be willing to compromise now, in order to avoid gridlock. This is a narrative the right is trying to build that I disagree with. As a matter of fact, I've seen people on the right claiming that the GOP has signaled a willingness to compromise, while the president is taking a harder line. That is simply false. Both the president and the GOP have stated that they are unwilling to negotiate on the question of tax rates, so neither party is showing more of a willingness to compromise, at the moment.

I see this as the GOP trying to create the narrative that they were ready to compromise, but the president wasn't, and that they also made it clear that if the president wasn't willing to compromise, he'd be responsible for any economic damage done by the fiscal cliff, as well as any gridlock that resulted. I think this is bunk, vigorously so.

It should be possible to to fix the regressive taxation without adjusting the rates themselves - if that is the best way to negotiate a deal.

But it is not. This is what the GOP wants - no tax rate increases, but they will discuss closing loopholes. This is the GOP being unwilling to compromise, as I mentioned above. Please read this article for more info on why just closing loopholes won't do the trick. Basically, Brooks and the GOP are trying to get the Democrats to cave before negotiations even start, and they're setting up a narrative which they'll try to use to place the blame for any gridlock or negative economic impact of the fiscal cliff on President Obama.

The Third Way document looks OK from a quick skim, but Brooks' article is arguing for a modification of that plan - namely, one which includes no higher taxes on the wealthy.

I believe you are falling for a false narrative here.

What the shit is that? There were times when I thought Digby was being too pessimistic, but then I basically watched the Democrats fold exactly as she said they would, time and time again, during the previous debt ceiling negotiations. Then we see the outlines of the "grand bargain" in that first post, and there's talk of cutting Tricare. Tricare! The one good thing we reliably do for our military and it's on the table?

Ben Stein jokes that Fox News might kill him for telling them taxes are ‘too low’

You do not think Washington just has a spending problem?” Steve Doocy wondered.

“I do not think they just have a spending problem,” Stein explained. “I think they also have a too-low taxes problem. And while all due respect to Fox, whom I love like brothers and sisters, the taxes are too low.”

[...]

“The evidence is that there is no connection between the level of taxation and the level of economic activity,” he pointed out. “The biggest growth we’ve ever had in this country was roughly 1941 to roughly 1973, that was the best years we ever had and those were years of much, much higher taxes than we have now, during war time and during peace time. So, the economy can grow very fast, even with much higher taxes. And we’re going to have to do something.”

“Taxes were like 70, 80 percent!” Doocy exclaimed.

“I know,” Stein agreed. “And yet, we were very prosperous, we were extremely prosperous. I mean, the highest rate was in the 90s during parts of the 50s and, yet, we were very prosperous.”

Of course the election taught them nothing. They've hardly been voted out of office in debilitating numbers. They're like learned rats at a lever, for reward; they're not likely to change. 

From a distance it looks as if the Republican party is diluting the US Presidency to a figurehead role, however if the President is nothing other than a state figurehead, he or she cannot be blamed for damaging democratic decisions. The Republicans can't have it both ways.

This election has taught them nothing.

Where I think this might head:

The difference between the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling is that there were immediate and catastrophic effects to not raising the debt ceiling -- just being recalcitrant about it dinged our national credit rating. But the effects of letting the tax increases and budget cuts roll in are slower and there is more time to respond to them. So it's not so much a fiscal cliff as a fiscal valley.

Boehner's problem is that he has a significant minority of freshman nut jobs who will defy him on this. He does have, especially since the Grover Norquist coalition is no longer a majority in the House, the ability to cut a deal with his loyal non-stupid caucus members and the Dems to do a compromise. The problem is that if he does that he will be seen as a traitor by the idiots, it will refocus attention on the rift in the Republican party, and Boehner will probably be finished as Speaker.

However, Boehner is caught between this rock and the hard place of not wanting to go down as tanking the economy on the principle of saving tax cuts for Papa John. The sane Republicans know that's a sure loser next election, and Boehner can't be Speaker if he can't get re-elected because of a record like that.

So I see a really strong possibility the Dems will take Krugman's advice and let the deadline pass, all the while broadcasting that the holdup is tax cuts for Bill Gates. That's anthrax for the Republicans, and I think Boehner might cave and do a bipartisan compromise against his own wrong wing rather than go down in history as the person who drove that boat over the waterfall.

Quarterly reports routinely cite the fiscal "cliff" as a potential risk for major companies. This means that as the "cliff" approaches, the markets are going to get jittery, and you know that means the Democrats will get jittery. The press will be full of reports about how "Congress" (not the Democrats or Republicans) are playing with fire. The pressure for a deal will be immense, and you know the GOP is more willing to shoot hostages.

I think you're right, and the president spoke, off-the-record, in some detail with the Des Moines Register about this. He then decided to allow the paper to print the interview, after they complained in an editorial. The idiots went on to endorse Romney, but whatever.

Here's the president talking about the Grand Deal, in response to a question from the Register about how he planned to overcome the gridlock of the previous years:

After editor's blog, President Obama releases transcript of Register interview
In the short term, the good news is that there’s going to be a forcing mechanism to deal with what is the central ideological argument in Washington right now, and that is: How much government do we have and how do we pay for it?

So when you combine the Bush tax cuts expiring, the sequester in place, the commitment of both myself and my opponent -- at least Governor Romney claims that he wants to reduce the deficit -- but we’re going to be in a position where I believe in the first six months we are going to solve that big piece of business. 

It will probably be messy. It won’t be pleasant. But I am absolutely confident that we can get what is the equivalent of the grand bargain that essentially I’ve been offering to the Republicans for a very long time, which is $2.50 worth of cuts for every dollar in spending, and work to reduce the costs of our health care programs.

Perhaps oddly, I think that actually works in the Democrats' favor. Being reality based, they can be confident that the immediate repercussions of missing the deadline are actually minor. They will be in the position of standing arms folded, resolution firm (Spines! Democratic spines! If it happens someone get a picture) while the Republicans play Chicken Little. Hey, if you really believe this is a crisis on the order of hitting an iceberg, and your guys are holding it all up over tax cuts for Ebenezer Scrooge, you're on the wrong side of the christmas carol.

Nobody knows till it shows but I did get a definite sense that Obama may have been waiting for the second term to really show his spine. There's nothing the GOP can do to him now politically, and I'm sure there was a fear on Obama's part that it would look bad in the history books if the first black President was a one-term wonder.

So far Obama has proven to be an extremely shrewd operator. Over and over again he has prevailed against forces that the CW thought insurmountable -- against Hillary in the primary, against a decorated experienced white war hero in the 2008 general, and now against a tsunami of dark money. Meanwhile he got significant stuff done, including a healthcare bill that's eluded his predecessors for decades, despite an opposition that wanted to shut him down completely.

This man is now in the driver's seat. The Republicans may have a technical majority in the House, but the sane people still have a majority -- if some of them are willing to split with their insane colleagues. I think making that happen will be the next great strategic play of the American political scene.

But the effects of letting the tax increases and budget cuts roll in are slower and there is more time to respond to them. So it's not so much a fiscal cliff as a fiscal valley.

I would be interested in hearing more about what people think of a further debt downgrade. Only one of the ratings agencies (S&P I think) downgraded the US, the other two are holding fire to see what happens with the fiscal cliff. They have indicated that to avoid a downgrade the US not only has to put into place a meaningful plan to reduce the debt but also show that our politicians can work together. I don't know if it's widely known that the reason (cited by S&P) for the debt downgrade was due, yes, to our debt; but it was also due, in large part to our dysfunctional Congress. I was just reading somewhere today that one of the other agencies (Moody's I think, I'll try to find it) has said that if the US did go over the fiscal cliff, that would be a big step towards starting to reduce the debt but that it would also say something about the continuing concerns about Congress being able to work together. So....maybe another downgrade?

My question is: what is the real problem with a debt downgrade? Contrary to what one would think, Treasuries rallied after the last downgrade and the US still remains the best of a bad bunch in terms of safe haven status. So what other problems are presented by a downgrade? I know a lot of institutional investors (pension funds, etc) can only invest in AAA bonds - is this the only other major concern of a downgrade or is there something I'm missing? In the event of a debt downgrade, what would be the likelihood of the pension funds adjsuting their rules to allow for AA US bonds?

U.S. Budget Deficit Widens as Fiscal Cliff, Debt Limit Loom

The deficit expanded 22 percent to $120 billion from a $98.5 billion shortfall in October 2011, the Treasury Department said today in Washington. The gap exceeded the $113 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

The deficits add to national debt, which will most likely hit the $16.4 trillion limit at the end of December, with extraordinary measures enabling the U.S. to meet its obligations “until early in 2013,” the Treasury Department said on Oct. 31.

So....maybe another downgrade?

If we hit the debt limit, we would either have to default on our debt, or spend only what is received in taxes, which would mean massive spending cuts. I presume a default would cause rate increases. Spending cuts would hurt a lot of people and probably the economy. I think this is the big problem, not necessarily a debt downgrade.

Please read this article for more info on why just closing loopholes won't do the trick.

Based on Tax Policy Center analysis, it appears the increase to marginal rates adds $31B in revenue. This article estimates a $25k deduction cap to create ~$100B revenue ($1.3T over 10yrs). I'm sure there is something wrong with this analysis, but it would seem to indicate it's not impossible to get $31B by reducing tax expenditures instead. It would be nice for the Tax Policy Center to do an estimate on this.


The wealthiest Americans, like Romney, seem to pay a very low tax rate, 15%, compared to the middle class; yet, the upper bracket income tax rates are quite high. 

This is a natural consequence of marginal tax rates in a progressive taxation system.

That's not what the Tax Policy Center analysis shows. Seems to me the only way to explain why Warren Buffet pays an obscenely lower tax rate then his secretary, is because of the capital gains tax rates, and possibly other deductions not available to the rest of us.

I don't understand why they don't seem to be proposing a capital gains tax increase. It's lower than it's ever been.

"Some time will be needed before any reformation is accepted. But as far as the voters are concerned, that god is dead."
Wishful thinking? The voters will need to demonstrate that more convincingly in 2014 because trickle-down economics remains alive, well, and the Republican's MO. There's been no smack down by the electorate in that regard. 

Voters have delivered as good as a 'hung parliament' to Obama. It happened in Britain and it happened in Australia after the Bush/Howard/Blair years. Welcome to ambivalent democracies.

So far half of Obama's first term has been squandered. It's looking like the 1st half of his 2nd term will likewise be squandered. ... pity Obama made his run in 2008 when, as the saying goes, a drover's dog could have led the Democrats to victory.

That article ignores a pretty big point, though. It's saying that people rejected a 20% tax cut overall. But from what I recall the Romney critics saying at the time, it wasn't that people disliked tax cuts, it's that no one thought it was real, because they couldn't figure the math on it and/or they listened to the Obama figures that said it would actually raise their taxes. Romney didn't do himself any favors either by promising vague things and not saying what he would actually cut.

So it's less "Would you prefer a ham sandwich, or a cheese sandwich" choice, and more "Would you prefer a ham sandwich, or a PONY-UNICORN?" "Uh, how are you getting the pony-unicorn? I see you have the ham sandwich right there in your hand..." "Don't worry about that, but it's totally going to get here." "In that case, I think I'll take the ham sandwich."

Spending cuts would hurt a lot of people and probably the economy. I think this is the big problem, not necessarily a debt downgrade.

I was thinking more in terms the end of year stuff, i.e. the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and the sequesteration cuts that kick in on January 2nd, rather than the debt ceiling limit, which (from what I've read) probably won't be reached until later in January. Although I believe (hope) that any deficit-reduction plan would include raising the debt ceiling. Given the consequences of not doing so, I am more confident of an agreement to raise the debt ceiling than I am of Congress coming to an agreement on how to avoid the fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases. I was wondering what the chances of a debt downgrade are based on going over the fiscal cliff either partially or fully. It looks as though Moody's has said they will downgrade the US credit rating if no agreement is reached on taxes:

In early September ratings agency Moody's Corp. (NYSE: MCO) announced it would likely downgrade the U.S. credit rating if no deal is reached before the end of the year, and on Monday the company reiterated its stance.

"A scenario whereby action on the budget is delayed until sometime in 2013 appears increasingly likely; for example, via a temporary extension of most measures except the increase in payroll tax," Moody's officials said.

"Such deferment, if not accompanied by an apparent commitment to achieving agreement and a credible timetable for implementing the necessary reforms to preserve sovereign creditworthiness, would be inconsistent with maintaining a AAA rating," they warned.

It looks like Fitch has also threatened a downgrade. S&P of course has already downgraded the US. 

In theory, the consequences of a downgrade would be higher borrowing costs as investors would demand a risk premium for US treasuries (which are the benchmark rate for a lot of consumer borrowing) and weakened consumer confidence. Given that Treasury yields were pushed to record lows last time this happened, I kind of wonder if a debt downgrade is really such a big deal at all.

I'm pretty sure that Romney said he would cut tax rates, not taxes. Both he and Ryan insisted these rate changes would be revenue neutral through closing loopholes, which means net taxes would stay the same. Of course, this would require magic and many people were paying enough attention to realize this was BS.

Obama and Biden tried to make it clear that these cuts in rates would essentially shift the tax burden downward from the wealthiest. I'm not sure that message really got through, but the message of the magic nature of the tax rate cuts did to a large swath of the electorate.

death of trickle-down economics.

The article starts with a discussion of the Laffer Curve, and each and every time that is mentioned I feel compelled to point out that at this time in history the Laffer Curve argues strongly for an INCREASE in the marginal tax rates for high income earners.

This time in history = (1) Large budget deficits and (2) a very, very low marginal tax rate of 35% for the highest income brackets. Not to mention (3) a ridiculously low capital gains rate of 15%.

The Laffer Curve shows the benefit of marginal tax rates of up to 70%.

In other words, it tells us the opposite of what the average nitwit means who starts blargghing on about 'Laffer Curve this, Laffer Curve that . . . '

And there is no need to go all the way up to 70% when times are good, but when we're in a crisis, facing a financial cliff, and the very future of our country is at stake--well, you know, in that extremely desperate situation, we just might consider it.

Thank you, thank you Laffer Curve for showing us the way out of this mess! And thank you, Republicans for letting us know that the time is right to implement this unpleasant, but necessary and effective, solution.

flug: The Laffer Curve shows the benefit of marginal tax rates of up to 70%.

While we're talking about trickle-down economics and shutting down canards, you all saw the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service report that shows clearly that tax cuts for the rich do not translate into economic growth at all, let alone the overall growth in taxes that tax-cut-for-the-wealthy proponents keep flogging.

From the report:
There is not conclusive evidence, however, to substantiate a clear relationship between the 65-year steady reduction in the top tax rates and economic growth. Analysis of such data suggests the reduction in the top tax rates have had little association with saving, investment, or productivity growth. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. . . . The evidence does not suggest necessarily a relationship between tax policy with regard to the top tax rates and the size of the economic pie, but there may be a relationship to how the economic pie is sliced.

I attended a symposium on a 'postmortem' of the election, with a number of political science professors presenting short presentations on takeaways from election night. It was interesting: mostly focusing on changing demographics, money in politics, and seeking explanations for why the republicans spent so much money on such small results. I thought it was pretty common sense stuff, repeating a lot of what has been covered over and over again in the press. 

At the end of the session, during the question and answer section, an outraged self-identified republican stood up and said that she couldn't sit around while people were attacking Mitt Romney and the GOP (notably, she didn't really ask a question so much as she went off on a five minute rant). The first point (and only point I heard, as I had to go to class) was that immigration reform was a non-issue, since 'why don't they just come to this country legally'.

Her 'question' really summed up the Republican reaction to election night for me.

Mitt Romney told his top donors Wednesday that his loss to President Obama was a disappointing result that neither he or his top aides had expected, but said he believed his team ran a “superb” campaign with “no drama,” and attributed his rival’s victory to “the gifts” the administration had given to blacks, Hispanics and young voters during Obama’s first term.

Obama, Romney argued, had been “very generous” to blacks, Hispanics and young voters. He cited as motivating factors to young voters the administration’s plan for partial forgiveness of college loan interest and the extension of health coverage for students on their parents’ insurance plans well into their 20s. Free contraception coverage under Obama’s healthcare plan, he added, gave an extra incentive to college-aged women to back the president.

Romney Blames Loss on Obama’s ‘Gifts’ to Minorities and Young Voters

He's right, but not in the way he thinks. They weren't gifts, just sensible rights that should have been made available decades ago.
In a conference call on Wednesday afternoon with his national finance committee, Mr. Romney said that the president had followed the “old playbook” of wooing specific interest groups — “especially the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people,” Mr. Romney explained — with targeted gifts and initiatives.

“In each case they were very generous in what they gave to those groups,” Mr. Romney said.

“With regards to the young people, for instance, a forgiveness of college loan interest, was a big gift,” he said. “Free contraceptives were very big with young college-aged women. And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents’ plan, and that was a big gift to young people. They turned out in large numbers, a larger share in this election even than in 2008."
Look Mitt, making college not such a burden, enabling availability of contraception, not matter what any religion or boss says and a half ass system so that people 1) get some health insurance and 2) not go broke from medical bills are not gimmees. That fact you keep saying they are indicates many people were correct in thinking you're an insensitive jackass.

As for African-Americians, we came out in similar numbers to 2008 just to say a little something and that would be 'Fuck you, GOP'. And it felt good.

Well, no duh. This is just snark on the internets, it is not rigorously tested for effectiveness.

Paul Ryan's Wisconsin neighbors supported his opponents

Janesville generally leans blue -- and Rock County had the 3rd highest percentage voting against Scott Walker in the recall election (after Madison/Dane and Milwaukee/Milwaukee). In his past elections -- against weak or unknown opponents -- Ryan has carried Janesville and Rock County with sizable majorities, though. With Rob Zerban at least we gave him a run for his money.

Also, the headline is fairly literal -- just two blocks away from his house is a ginormous Victorian that has hosted one Democratic fundraiser after another and whose family actually gave various Obama/Democrat staffers room and board support. His actual voting ward, the 13th, went for Obama 932-483, or 65% to 34%. (It has some of the city's nicest historic homes, but also a fair number of working class rentals.) In the Congressional, they went for Zerban 807-569, or 57.5% to 41.5%.

In combination with his "stop being dumb" comments from earlier, it looks like Jindal is going to try and set himself up as a reasonable centrist for 2016. Or at least as a Romney that doesn't say out loud what should be dog whistled to the base.

LAS VEGAS — Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal forcefully rejected Mitt Romney’s claim that he lost because of President Barack Obama’s “gifts” to minorities and young voters.

“No, I think that’s absolutely wrong,” he said at a press conference that opened the RGA’s post-election meeting here. “Two points on that: One, we have got to stop dividing the American voters. We need to go after 100 percent of the votes, not 53 percent. We need to go after every single vote.

“And, secondly, we need to continue to show how our policies help every voter out there achieve the American Dream, which is to be in the middle class, which is to be able to give their children an opportunity to be able to get a great education. … So, I absolutely reject that notion, that description. I think that’s absolutely wrong.”

And then, finally, Obamacare also made a difference for them, because as you know, anybody now 26 years of age and younger was now going to be part of their parents’ plan, and that was a big gift to young people.

Yeah, I just-- this was a great plan that probably helped saved lives. It wasn't free. It wasn't a giveaway. Millions of young Americans got (paid-for-by-themselves/families!) access to doctors, to drugs, to therapy, to biopsies, to prenatal care, to glasses, and whatever the hell else broken bodies need. How terrible! What pandering! I would much rather my peers have put off necessary surgery and died!

Exclusive analysis: If trends hold, Texas will be a toss-up state by 2024. Excerpt:
If current demographic trends continue, Democrats would whittle about 5 1/2 percentage points off the 15.8-point margin of victory won by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012 in every subsequent presidential cycle. That would transform Texas — the center of Republican resistance to Barack Obama’s agenda — into a competitive state at the presidential level by 2020 and a toss-up state four years later.

“I think 2020 is a reasonable time frame for Texas to become truly competitive, particularly if Republicans don’t begin to cut into the Democratic advantage with Hispanic voters,” said GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak.

These Romney comments being reported now is the reason why I think people thought his concession speech was "classy". I think a lot people would not have been surprised if he made some these divisive and irresponsible remarks during the concession. But he's making them now which kind of proves that plutocratic Mitt at the 47% fundraiser really was the real Mitt. 

It's pathetic, really, to see him chip away what little reputation he has left. I can just see Romney years from now, sitting alone in his home theatre room, watching the first debate over and over again. Mr. Lehrer, I'm ready for question now ...

"It's all in the old playbook — treat the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people like they deserve the same benefits and privileges as old white people."

Romney, who lost to Obama by 126 electoral votes, said the president courted voters by offering policies - some of them this election year - that appealed to key constituencies.

Yes, for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act appealed to key constituencies such as a) people who are sick and b) people who might become sick at some point in the future.

In the wake of all the Allen West posts, I will say that one of the things Florida did right in 2010 was to vote for fair redistricting, making gerrymandering against our constitution. West (who actually lives in Debbie Wasserman Schultz's district) knew he would lose in his newly formed district -- so he went to the district where he ran this time. Murphy followed him, in a rare display of Democratic backbone. 

However, the new district that West and Murphy ran in is pretty evenly split in terms of Republicans and Democrats. It covers parts of Palm Beach County, Martin County, and St. Lucie County. Martin is pretty firmly Republican, while Palm Beach and St. Lucie are pretty firmly Democrat. Notice where West has put all of his efforts. 

I'll be happy when West finally realizes that it's over. I'm just not convinced that will be soon. Or ever.

I'm quite sure it will be. The way to reach previously-othered minorities is to find another group to other and invite the minorities to join in on the finger-pointing. Minorities aren't any more resistant to becoming part of the tribe, blaming someone else for their problems, and voting against their own best interests than majorities are.

Maine GOP Head Suspects Voter Fraud Because ‘Dozens, Dozens Of Black People’ Voted
"In some parts of rural Maine, there were dozens, dozens of black people who came in and voted on Election Day. Everybody has a right to vote, but nobody in town knows anyone who’s black. How did that happen? I don’t know. We’re going to find out…."
That's right, folks -- "Voting While Black" is now a crime. Because, as we all know, a few dozen black folks voting in rural Maine was totally going to swing the Pine Tree State from "Obama" to "even Obama-er".

I urge you all not to count the Republicans out yet. As mentioned a little above, they have done a terrific, horrific job of getting people to vote against their immediate interests. They can do it again. They are undoubtedly right now scheming to put in place organizations to "teach" people immigrants about the US. I think Gingrich may even have started planting the seeds of that on Colbert two nights ago, with his remark that he thinks it's great people can come from anywhere on earth and learn to be Americans. He doesn't mean our kind of Americans.

Neither side has survived this long without being to some degree protean, about to remake itself at need. The Republicans certainly aren't dead yet, and indeed gerrymandering has given them a durable hold on state legislatures that is doing to be extremely painful in the coming years. I'm sure that combined with the right-leaning Surpreme Court will give us lots of outrage posts in the coming years.

Mitt Romney Says Bill Clinton Told Him Hurricane Sandy Won Obama Election

Romney:
”I spoke with President Clinton the day before yesterday, he called and spent 30 minutes chatting with me. He said a week out I thought you were going to win. And he said, but the hurricane happened, and it gave the president a chance to be presidential, and to look bipartisan, and you know he got a little more momentum, and of course he also said that when he was watching Ann speak at the Republican convention, he decided he was tempted to join the Republican Party. So he may have just been effusive with generous comments as he chatted.”

Also, I hear that if you eat it, then UN/USA AGENDA 21 will make you go into local sewers, and pull it out by the bucket-load and compost it anyway, and then grow all your Socialist Garden vegetables using it... using it as soap and candles sounds pretty cool though.

JHarris: "I urge you all not to count the Republicans out yet."

Especially when Republicans can win on policy even when they're losing elections:
What movement conservatism has accomplished is the imposition of severe limits on how far U.S. policy can move to the left on most issues, even when support for a leftward shift is overwhelming, and even when the liberal (or moderate) policies clearly work.

[...]

How do movement conservatives win these victories? By demonizing Democrats and liberals at every opportunity. Clinton is a murdering, raping, coke-snorting drug-trafficker. Obama is a race-war-leading Muslim Marxist. Nancy Pelosi is a witch; Ted Kennedy was a murderer; Al Gore is a serial liar; John Kerry won war medals via fraud. They all hate Jews and Christians and people who listen to country music; they all want to enslave America.

How much progress could we have made if movement conservatives hadn't spent the last generation standing athwart history, yelling "Oogabooga -- liberals must be destroyed"?

Wonkette: WITHOUT GALLUP’S CRAPPY POLLS, NATE SILVER IS NOTHING, SAYS GALLUP
You might point out that Gallup actually had Romney ahead way outside the margin of error going into the final week of the campaign, then rather abruptly changed to be more in line with every other reputable polling company. This may have looked like herding, where pollsters start adjusting their methods because they’re afraid they’re wildly wrong, but Frank Newport would like to make it clear that this was not the case and Obama’s numbers just suddenly shifted for the better at the last minute. Was it because of Superstorm Sandy? Hard to say, but the change came after the storm, so yes, almost certainly.

But then he really lets you know what he thinks of math and numbers nerds like Nate Silver, who dare to sift through multiple publicly available yet contradictory sources of information to make sense of them

Ezra Klein's Wonkblog had a post about that. Here's the bit you're looking for:
It can be a bit difficult to tally up the popular vote in House elections because you have to go ballot by ballot, and many incumbents run unopposed. But The Washington Post’s Dan Keating did the work and found that Democrats got 54,301,095 votes while Republicans got 53,822,442. That’s a close election — 48.8%-48.5% –but it’s still a popular vote win for the Democrats. Those precise numbers might change a bit as the count finalizes, but the tally isn’t likely to flip.
This is from Nov. 9th. I haven't seen any newer numbers.

NYT: Gay Vote Proved a Boon for Obama. Excerpt:
While President Obama’s lopsided support among Latino and other minority voters has been a focus of postelection analysis, the overwhelming support he received from another growing demographic group — Americans who identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual — has received much less attention.

But the backing Mr. Obama received from gay voters also has a claim on having been decisive. Mitt Romney and Mr. Obama won roughly an equal share of votes among straight voters nationwide, exit polls showed. And, a study argues, Mr. Romney appears to have won a narrow victory among straight voters in the swing states of Ohio and Florida.

Mr. Obama’s more than three-to-one edge in exit polls among the 5 percent of voters who identified themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual was more than enough to give him the ultimate advantage, according to the study, by Gary J. Gates of the Williams Institute at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, in conjunction with Gallup. The results are consistent with earlier research on the number and political beliefs of gay voters.
Turns out basing your electoral appeal on gay-bashing comes back to bite you in the ass. And not in the nice way, either.

OK, whatever. You obviously don't know that GM paid back its bailout via TARP, although a US government interest remains in stock, nor that Ford took no bailout dollars at all. I think you have a vague political axe-grind to make here, but you're factually inaccurate, since sales are definitely recovering and costs for all three "American" automakers have been significantly reduced. I live in one of the cities where a GM plant is on hold for an increase in production, so I do pay attention to this. The bailout happened, regardless, and it's done; there isn't any ongoing cash infusion, and the Big Three are going to have to make it on their own from here.

By the way, GM, Ford, and Chrysler are all in the Asian markets, profitably. You could even say that GM's Chinese presence is keeping the US arm afloat through all this.

SAIC Motor Corp. (600104), the Chinese partner of General Motors Co. (GM) and Volkswagen AG (VOW), said its vehicle sales growth will outpace the industry in 2013, driven by an improving economy and buyers shunning Japanese brands.

SAIC, which makes Buick and Chevrolet cars with GM, expects sales to increase seven percent to eight percent next year, faster than the five percent to seven percent growth for the industry, according to President Chen Hong, citing projections based on current conditions.

OK, whatever? No need to take offence. That's half the battle.

I didn't know GM paid back bailout money, no, but it will require assistance again if Western trends are anything to go by. America is not uniquely in this situation was my point. 

I did know Ford knocked back bailout -- something to do with not accepting the regulations that came with it; and I recall reading Chrysler (I think) failed to meet the regulations after accepting bailout dollars and was somehow penalised. Not the point either.

These are companies that do have profitable plants in the East. In the long run the people who suffer through unsustainable auto industries being propped up are the communities who've build lives around these industries. 

My concern is in Obama not pursuing Green reforms. I certainly heard him campaigning on it including the car industry's involvement. The auto industry failing again opens the way for Republicans to get a stronger regressive foothold than it already has and it'll be 1960 all over again ... and not just for the US but also for the countries within the US sphere of influence.

A social axe would be my only axe to grind. The Eastern plants may be keeping Ford, Chrysler and GM somewhat afloat in the US (doubt it), but it will not sustain communities of people beyond corporate reason.

Ford didn't take the bailout because it mortgage itself to the hilt before the capital markets seized up and were therefore not desperate. The bailout came with lots of strings attached, as well as a giant PR hit; nobody sane did it unless they had to. 

When there is demand for green vehicles, the US automakers will produce them -- they are already investing most of their R&D in it. Suggesting that such demand will be sufficient to topple them before they figure out how to meet it -- much less in a year -- is not very realistic.

When there is demand for green vehicles, the US automakers will produce them

There would be plenty of demand for green vehicles if Americans had to pay the full/actual cost of driving.

You need to add $1/gallon tax just to pay the actual cost of the roads and highways we drive on, plus associated services like police, fire, and ambulance, plus other associated direct costs like environmental mitigation and runoff.

Then add another $.25-$.50-$1.00 per gallon (don't know the exact cost, but it is high) to pay the full cost of wars and project of force, the main justification for which is protect oil markets.

Then add on another $1/gallon to cover the cost of pollution and climate change burning that gallon of gas directly causes.

(A reference that summarizes many of the above costs--they are far, far higher than most people imagine.)

Add that $2-$3/gallon to the cost of gas in the U.S. and I guarantee you that green vehicles would immediately have a market--and a large one.

Right now we are subsidizing all of those costs from other tax dollars or, in the case of pollution and greenhouse gases, by shedding them off onto the general economy as externalities.

Automobile driving is one of the most heavily subsidized activities that 'average' Americans routinely participate in--truly a "motorist welfare state".

It's Elizabeth Warren's Senate, Not Bob Kerrey's
In the long term, a Senate with no Liebermans or Kerreys is a Senate with fewer Democratic media stars who want to cut entitlements. In the short term, doesn't this embolden the liberals who want to scrap a grand bargain? The theory of the bargain is that neither party really suffers from it. The angry voter will hate the Republicans for selling him out on taxes and the Democrats for selling him out on Medicare. But entitlements are more popular than tax cuts. There was a reason why dozens of Republican candidates promised to spend another $718 billion on Medicare if they won.
Also, an eye-popping statistic from the Atlantic article Weigel references:

West Palm Beach, FL: John Metz, Denny's Franchisee And Hurricane Grill & Wings Owner, Imposes Surcharge For Obamacare 
Metz said he understands the problems that will create not just for his scheduling but for his employees. "I think it's a terrible thing. It's ridiculous that the maximum hours we can give people is 28 hours a week instead of 40," Metz said. "It's going to force my employees to go out and get a second job."

Despite the one-two hit his employees might take with possibly fewer hours and lower tips, Metz said he is not anti-insurance. His current coverage for full-time employees costs him $5,000 to $6,000 annually, he said. "Obviously, I'd love to cover all our employees under that insurance," he said, "But to pay $5,000 per employee would cost us $175,000 per restaurant, and unfortunately, most of our restaurants don't make $175,000 a year. I can't afford it."

Currently, the law states that employers with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees will be charged a penalty for any employees over 30 full-time employees that they don't cover. Several employers have cited that provision -- including Darden Restaurants, Papa John's, Apple-Metro and Jimmy John's -- in announcing plans to skirt the law by cutting employees' hours to make them part time.

Metz said he will take the extra step of adding a surcharge because he believes the law will eventually expand to include penalties for not covering full-time equivalent employees. If he has to pay a penalty for his average 35 full-time equivalent employes per restaurant, he said it would cost him $75,000 per location. In that case, he said raising prices wouldn't be an option, since he'd have to raise prices about 25 percent to cover the costs of Obamacare, which would be "catastrophic" for his business.

I don't want to get into a car industry derail, but you do know that hybrids/electric cars have been pushed by Ford & GM despite their relative lack of profitability, right? It is true that they are organizationally inept in many ways, but as far back as the late 90s, when I was a mechanical engineering intern in Dearborn, people were working on greener cars. 

What GM and Ford will not do is lead. That's not what they're good at, and not what I'd ever expect from them. They will, however, follow the market (the lessons of the 70s have not been forgotten in Detroit). They are big, and they will adapt as fast as they can (slowly).

Wow, that makes for some interesting reading.
Apparently, “The Protectors” were able to completely thwart Karl Rove’s attempts to manipulate this election by employing a firewall to stop man-in-the-middle tabulation attacks and improper transfers of tabulation data. Moreover, apparently, they were able to pinpoint and exploit flaws and structural weaknesses in Project Orca that caused a cascading of problems and subsequent catastrophic failure. Apparently, there was some connection between Mr. Rove and Project Orca, and they were probably both plugged into the same voter database.
So some possible conclusions:

1. "The Protectors" is one guy making up shit. 

2. "The Protectors" hacked into Orca and caused mayhem on election day but didn't really affect the outcome.

3. Karl Rove is a criminal who planned to steal the election but luckily for us a group of nice guys prevented that from happening with their ninja hacking skillz. No need to thank us; yr welcome, America.

Nobody actually uses the phrase "password protected firewall". That isn't a thing. If you google that phrase, there's no actual instructions on how to do that because it's utterly bizarre phrasing. It's not technically wrong in the sense that it's impossible, it's just something that wouldn't ever be said by someone who knows what they're doing.

There's no such thing really as password protected firewall as a manner of normal implementation, because a firewall is designed to BLOCK PACKETS, you don't really password protect it, you can password protect access to the ACL, but that's implied. There's no place to put in a password when you're messing with iptables for a reason, you can theoretically set up a password protected port "knocking" packet, but nobody actually does that.

A password protected VPN, on the other hand does exist, but emphasizing the "password protected" part when talking about VPNs is bizarre too, because it's sort-of implied, and isn't impressive grandstanding. They didn't mention a password protected VPN, though. They mentioned a password protected firewall.

They also mentioned tunnels (VPNs that supposedly Rove set up) from 3 different states. Nobody does a geographic attachment to IP addresses when describing them. People normally say "3 different IPs". FAAAKEEEE.

We all know since America decided Romney was not The One that the Republicans have been flailing around, looking for a new leader. Well they can relax, GOP Identity Crisis Solved — Santorum Preparing 2016 Presidential Run. Yep. He's figured out what went wrong and has said that Romney didn't "vigorously defend the beliefs that he said he espoused and didn’t go on the offense.”
“A leading evangelical leader who is close to Santorum and asked not to be identified, told The Christian Post on Wednesday that Santorum is ‘organizing and making all the necessary preparations’ for another run in the 2016 Republican primary,” the Christian Post reports:

“Rick’s getting ready organized and is not going to be behind the eight-ball when it comes to fundraising and building a grassroots organization,” the anonymous source said. “I think you’ll see and hear a lot from Rick in the next 12 months.”[snip]

“As a result of this election,” Santorum wrote, “we now need to engage with even more energy and commitment not just in politics, but in our daily lives, to ensure that the values upon which our country has prospered will continue.” And here is the kicker: “Karen and I look forward to working side by side with you to make that happen.”
It looks like he is going to be Romney 2.0-- hold office, lose re-election, run for President, lose the GOP primary, run for President for 4 more years while doing very little else except fundraise. Plus extra add Far Right Christianity. Good luck trying to run for President in 2016 without LGBTs, women, or minorities. Oh and he will probably lose a good portion of that white man vote if he continues on with his War on Porn.

I went to one of Santorums campaign meetings last year. It was ... odd. I was the token European there (somewhat surreal when he started talking about how Europeans were so lazy, causing their current downfall). Briefly spoke with him, shook hands, listened to his speech and him answer questions; tweeted during it (I had to stop at one point as what he was saying was just too extreme) and blogged about it later.

The thing is; he really does believe in what he is saying. That's a big point I'll give him; he's not fake in that respect (though he is fake in doing a 180 and endorsing Romney) and knows he is saying things that are unpopular. Got the impression he's inherently disappointed that most of America doesn't believe in what he does.

He hasn't a hope of becoming president. It would be a landslide of Mondale proportions. Actually, considering his performance in his "home" state of Pennsylvania, he'd lose that as well. Less landslide, more wipeout.

As it turns out, there actually is cause for concern about vote counting in the West/Murphy race. I don't want to see him in Congress again, and these types of irregularities exist in virtually every race in every election year, but I think the powers that be should take these concerns seriously and do an exhaustive recount.

West is a hypocrite who would do everything he could to block a recount if he were in Murphy's position, but that doesn't mean the Democrats should stoop to his level.

That Anonymous hack letter is soooo fake. "We coded and created, what we call, The Great Oz. A targeted password protected firewall that we tested and refined over the past weeks" Nobody actually uses the phrase "password protected firewall". That isn't a thing.

While I consider the possibility that it's a fake more likely, there are at least two other ways of explaining the jargon that's off in the letter:

(a) the knowledge of the technical details is secondhand -- that is, the author knows a technician who was part of this and explained it to him, but was non- or marginally technical himself.

(b) the author was awkwardly trying to communicate in terminology they felt would make sense to non-technical people.

I'm probably straining credibility a bit. But there's a part of my head that thinks it stinks that Rove and Romney were so confident about Ohio that they were publicly in denial after the count was coming in. That and the weird Romney intrade surge in the evening. 

There are other explanations for those things too, of course: epistemic closure and selective attention could have created the false confidence, and depending on where you were getting your news in the evening and how well you understand the election process, it's possible you would bet on Romney doing well. But I wonder.

I think it wouldn't be close at all between Palin and Clinton, even granting the huge assumption that Palin would try to play the compassionate conservative and that she would actually succeed.

1) Palin has never been prepared to do the hard work of campaigning. Clinton would bury her.
2) Palin has an incredible job ahead of her to even approach Clinton's probable favorability rating in 2016 (given these 2012 numbers for Clinton). A substantial portion of the country in 2011 said that they wouldn't ever vote for her as president. Palin could possibly turn these ratings around, but that would require work. See #1.
3) I think the "most attractive candidate" rule, as well as the Redskins rule and tallest candidate rule, was broken this year. Hey, I think Obama is one handsome guy, ears and all, but I think the majority of the country still has a thing for Handsome White Daddy With Greying Temples But Otherwise Great Hair.
4) After a certain age, women tend to get compared on competence more than looks. Clinton is showing her age, but Palin is slipping there, too. 

Now, the age difference between them may be an advantage for Palin as far as perceived energy goes, but she has such a gap on competence that memories of a 2008 hairstyle, a wink, and FM shoes won't be enough to make up for that.

IRT Palin and looks. I really hesitate to "go there", but I suppose it is in response to everyone saying she's a fox and good looking etc... Last time I saw her on television, oh a month or so ago, she really has changed from 2008. I've no idea if it is just aging, or poor plastic surgery or just a really bad day but she'd have a difficult time running on her looks. And that is probablly an ok thing as then people may pay better attention to her rhetoric. 

I don't think Palin is that good of a debater, and I suspect that is one of those things that kept her out of the primary this year, as she'd have to stand up and talk semi integrable against other people without writing on her hand. 

I've always thought she'd pull a 3rd party route. Minimal debating, no primary, has experience with 3rd party politics, don't have to talk policy, just slogans...

So, in the long run I actually doubt she'll actually make a play for the brass ring. Just someone else out there stringing people along.

We are talking about a woman who declined to even contest the last Republican primary, in a season that looked like an easy win at the time. Tbh, I think that "Sarah Palin, Presidential material" is a proposition that appeals to pretty small fraction of the country, namely Sarah Palin and a group of people who deeply identify with her. The size of that group is the key question here and no one knows that for certain. But the evidence we do have suggests that it isn't—at this time, anyway—big enough to build a successful campaign on. 

I sure would like to see her try, though.

Actually, right after the Palin nomination, I saw some video of her in a debate during the gubernatorial campaign, and she was actually fairly impressive. She spoke deliberately, had facts and figures at her fingertips, and seemed -- that word again -- competent.

Short excerpt.

Full debate.

The woman isn't stupid, she has shown discipline and determination before (as a runner, as a gubernatorial candidate and, for at least a little while, as governor), but once she got brought up to the national level, she floundered badly. She couldn't scale to the level of knowledge and stamina required to campaign for national office.

I think IF she's been practicing secretly with Karl Rove for the past 4 years, and practiced secretly for another 4 years (huge IF) she would be fine. GWB was fine in his debates and he was a horrible speaker, as bad as Palin, I think.

Look at Mitt Romney this year. He sucked. Badly. Even in the debate he "won." And yet he acquired HUGE legitimacy just be appearing confident and lying his ass off.

I think Palin's past nuttery does currently preclude any sort of serious consideration ... right now. I also think she could still turn it around and become GWB II, but I admit, it's a huge stretch.

even granting the huge assumption that Palin would try to play the compassionate conservative

What else is the GOP candidate going to do in 2016? We're going to have 3-4 more major natural disasters by then, unemployment will be double digits, and the Hispanic/Latino/immigration vote will be even bigger ... I'm not sure how they're going to do it, but they have to try. It's the only way they've (semi)won a presidential election in 20 years.

She couldn't scale to the level of knowledge and stamina required to campaign for national office.

GWB used to be a good debater. I don't know what was behind his decline between Texas and the national level, but he did decline.

Anyway, an earpiece won't fix public perceptions of Palin. You'd have to call in Miracle Max, not Rove, to see any shift in how seriously she's taken. Plus, I think she just doesn't have the confidence any more. She's held together with bravado and chewing gum right now.

I also think she could still turn it around and become GWB II, but I admit, it's a huge stretch.

She'd have to be Nixon II, not GWB II, because Nixon's the only politician to resuscitate such a doomed career. More to the point, though, why would the GOP take a chance on Palin? What does she bring to the table? If it's Rich Lowry's "little starbursts," well, there are plenty of women out there who can bring the same dazzle. If it's wingnuttery, the GOP is all stocked up there, also. That's the only thing she brings and by either of those metrics, a FOX News babe/Liz Cheney ticket has better odds. 

In some ideal set of circumstances, Palin could President. Stranger things have happened and American politics gets stranger every year. But winning the Presidency, rather than just being awarded it, would seem to require Palin become a completely different person than she has been until now.

My take on Palin is that she likes the beauty pageant side of politics. She likes the cheering crowds, the adoring fans , the millions of facebook followers. What she doesn't like is the work involved with actual government jobs. She has quit twice now, and I see no reason to believe that she wants to take on the tremendous responsibility of being President. Rather I see her giving her speeches and appearing on FOX until she gets too old to be appealing.

She wouldn't if her goal in running was to win the nomination (and the election). But serving in government is not her goal anymore; running for office is a way to keep the Palin brand alive, and to keep the money coming in. 

Once you become aware of possibility of using the right-wing as a money making proposition, you see more and more public figures whose behavior is really well explained by it. Gingrich was the first one I had pointed out for me. The minute Palin resigned from being Governor you knew that's what she was doing. 

So Palin might make an attempt at the nomination, but not for the reasons she will claim.

In hopeful "can't we all just get along" news - I had an early Thanksgiving on Sunday with my parents, aunt, and my mom's cousins. Make that: my Democrat parents, my tea-party aunt, and my mom's Republican cousins.

About halfway through dinner, my father suddenly said, "okay - I'm only going to ask this one question and then I'm gonna drop it - the election. What do y'all think?" But despite my concerns for how that was gonna go (my immediate reaction was to crack a joke by telling Dad "ABORT THE MISSION! ABORT THE MISSION!"), everyone made a lot of "yeah, we'd better not go there" noises, and then my mother, my aunt, and their female cousin got talking instead about how many women got elected to Congress and how cool that was. In fact, my mom's cousin was talking about how she'd wished a Democrat woman had won her election (she couldn't remember name or state, so I'm not sure who ths was), because that woman had been stationed in Iraq at some point and had refused to comply with the request that all US Service Women and Diplomats stationed there should wear the hijab, and that kind of grit and resolve was more important to her than party politics.

I mean, I personally think the whole issue she was talking about was more complicated than that, but it's a sign that maybe people are turning away from the partisan "our party rules and your party drools" thinking that we've been faced with for so long.

Probably as good an occasion as any - I've been musing lately about the Republicans' use of the word 'socialism,' and, in a broader sense, the use of the word 'socialism' in US political discourse.

What's puzzling to me is that the word has a pretty exact definition, and I don't really see how it can be correctly applied to really any of the policies of the current Democratic party. Can someone fill me in here? I've been arguing with conservatives lately that there is no socialism in the US, and hardly any in Western Europe. Is there something I'm missing here?

Alright, so I'm going to attempt to explain this, from a little bit of my perspective and a little bit of potentially other perspectives.

First, to say that there is one clear, exact definition of socialism, I think is flawed. A little preliminary googling revealed a few different options - Wikipedia grants us
Modern socialism originated from an 18th-century intellectual and working class political movement that criticised the effects of industrialisation and private property on society. In the early 19th-century, "socialism" referred to any concern for the social problems of capitalism irrespective of the solutions to those problems. However, by the late 19th-century, "socialism" had come to signify opposition to capitalism and advocacy for an alternative system based on some form of social ownership... In the late 20th century, the term "socialist" has also been used by Third way social democrats to refer to an ethical political doctrine focusing on a common set of values emphasizing social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality

So under some of these definitions, Obama is absolutely, one hundred percent, espousing policies as a socialist. Whether he believes them or not, he is certainly arguing for a common set of values that emphasize social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality, and doing what he can to bring them about. Universal healthcare on the grounds that it will benefit the welfare of all is that. Universal education - access to higher education for all is certainly that. Universal food for all is certainly that.

I think that a lot of people who agree with more progressive values simply don't see that as socialist, because to them, socialism has a more strict definition - party socialism, or complete social ownership of the means of production, as is mentioned elsewhere. But that doesn't mean it is wrong to call Obama a socialist, by certain very real definitions of the word socialist. I think a lot of people bristle at the term, because it is considered derogatory in common discourse (a lot of holdover from the Cold War, primarily), but that doesn't mean that Obama is not in some ways a socialist or doesn't endorse policies that could legitimately be called socialist policies.

A lot of people I think also believe implicitly in those common set of values around social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality - people that are, in the common parlance, often termed liberals. They also, erroneously, tend to assume that those values are shared more broadly than they are. Social cooperation, universal welfare, and de facto equality are not, in fact, embraced by all of the population. This is, in fact, a controversy, even though it's hard for some people to imagine that it is.

corb: A lot of people I think also believe implicitly in those common set of values around social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality - people that are, in the common parlance, often termed liberals.
Quite right. The kind of people who might believe in a document that starts out with this startling display of liberal socialism:
We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Hell is freezing over and I'm almost agreeing with corb. I certainly don't think the right is calling Obama and the Democratic Party socialists because they understand socialism to be a broad enough concept to encompass the part of the Democratic Party with social democratic tendencies (perhaps that's Howard Dean's 'Democratic wing of the Democratic Party', if anyone remembers that). They're calling people socialists because 'socialism' is a dirty word.

Of course, Bernie Sanders and the state of Vermont would like to remind you that socialists are, in fact, electable in the US.

Re: Obama as socialist.

While it is reasonable to characterize President Obama as having some of the values that characterize social democratic thought, and therefore, as some kind of socialist, when it is used as a pejorative, the term 'socialist' is being used as a stand-in for something like "damn communist," which is really not what Obama stands for, at all. It's a conflating of two very different meanings. It's convenient, and dangerously misleading.

Well, yeah, it's an intentionally misleading slur from people who don't understand socialism and use it in the same way that they used "liberal" just a few years ago. It's nonsense, and reaching back to the 19th century to justify it just shows how strained it is. 

"Social cooperation, universal welfare, and de facto equality are not, in fact, embraced by all of the population."

Right, they're rejected by blinkered Got-Mine-ism and fools ascribing to emotionally gratifying but objectively false philosophies of debased liberalism.

There's a difference between someone who is willing to use Socialist policies and a person who is a Socialist. (Do we call Otto von Bismarck a Socialist?) I'd hope for national leaders who are willing to use any range of market-based open competition measures or government supervised or government run strategies. 

If "Obama is a Socialist", by the same definition Romney, Bush II, Clinton, Bush I, Reagan, Carter, Nixon, LBJ, Kennedy, Eisenhower, Truman, and FDR were also Socialists. 

But us hashing out the definition here won't go anywhere, because it misses the deeper fact that many, many Americans are living with a completely inaccurate view of just how self-reliant they are. "Government, Keep your hands off of my Medicare!" is just the most extreme expression of it.

Conservative minded scholars and philosophers of at least the last two centuries would argue that "a common set of values that emphasize social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality" are most definitively core to conservative thinking.

It is merely the modern talking heads who have come to dominate the mind space of TV-Conservatism (which is far closer to reactionary/revolutionary ideas which are connected to 'liberalism'); only they would refer to those "common values" as virtues, and laugh at the thought of people using "values" as interchangeable with virtues.

The very foundation of the United States is to emphasize social cooperation, the amelioration of regional differences in natural resources which lead from petty squabbles, into regional conflicts that have engulfed and enflamed the passions of violence so commonly in the history of Europe.

I don't know about the "common welfare" bit, which is pretty loaded in modern discourse, but, well, conservative scholars speak highly of community, family, cohesion and protection of "our own" -- the modern world means that "our own" are not always our biological families... but community health is absolutely a conservative "thing" (as much as a liberal "thing").

But how exactly are we defining Satanism? It's not as clear-cut as you might think. For example, Wikipedia says,
Satanism is a broad term referring to a group of Western religions comprising diverse ideological and philosophical beliefs. Their shared features include symbolic association with, or admiration for the character of, Satan, or similar rebellious, promethean, and, in their view, liberating figures.
Christianity -- which Barack Hussein Obama CLAIMS to practice -- does indeed make numerous references to Satan. Is he a Satanist? I'm not saying he is, but you can't deny that the people who call him a SatanWorshipper might have a point.

Now, we all know he has two children. Are we saying for SURE that he's never annoyed them? I imagine that they probably get annoyed at him from time to time. By that definition, is Obama actually a child molester? I simply don't know. But I do know that these things are rarely as clear-cut as they appear.

corb: In the late 20th century, the term "socialist" has also been used by Third way social democrats to refer to an ethical political doctrine focusing on a common set of values emphasizing social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality

Thanks for your response, but I'm just going to have to call "malarkey" on that particular sentence in the Wikipedia article.

Here's the sentence that follows your quote: "It ['socialism'] is used in this way by Third Way proponent Anthony Giddens, who rejects conventional definitions and implementations of socialism."

Giddens is mentioned twice in the article, both times with very similar assertions about this nonstandard definition of 'socialism.' Helpfully, footnotes are provided, four of them, in fact. And all four of them point to the same exact page in a book written by Mr. Giddens. My reading of the page suggests that Mr. Giddens is summarizing another writer's work, one Anthony Crosland, rather than attempting to redefine 'socialism,' himself.

In short, the only support for this nonstandard definition of the word is what I would consider the misinterpretation of a single passage on a single page in a single book.

Furthermore, Crosland's work on socialism, The Future of Socialism, "was highly controversial at the time of its publication." Some on the left - i.e. the 'owners' of the term 'socialism' - felt strongly that Crosland was not a socialist. Crosland argued that the classic definition of 'socialism' was incorrect or too narrow, but it was only an argument, and a very controversial one, at that.

So, really, all Wikipedia has to bolster the credibility of this alternate definition of the term is one page in one book, in which the author's summarization of another man's controversial idea is misinterpreted as the first author's own opinion.

Color me highly unimpressed. Or, allow me to redefine the word 'capitalism' here and now, as state or communal ownership of the means of production and control over the distribution of goods, and I'll concede to your argument. In other words, a word either has a meaning, or it does not. Either anyone can redefine a word, at a whim, in which case every word means nothing (or everything, take your pick), or else each word has a meaning.

I'm generally not a linguistic prescriptivist, but I do think that terms such as "socialist" cannot simply be redefined on a whim, when they had very specific meanings beforehand.

Redefining politically-charged, well-defined words is something propagandists, ideologues and Republicans do. I don't think it's a practice serious thinkers engage in, often.

I find the following short passage on the Third Way instructive, as it relates to Giddens and the discussion of the meaning of 'socialism':
Put at its most basic the Third Way is something different and distinct from liberal capitalism ... and democratic socialism ... The Third Way is in favour of growth, entrepeneurship, enterprise and wealth creation but it is also in favour of greater social justice and it sees the state playing a major role in bringing this about. So in the words of one of its gurus Anthony Giddens ... the Third Way rejects top down socialism as it rejects traditional neo liberalism.
Again, I think the sentence corb quoted from the Wikipedia article is a very poor source to depend on if she wants to argue for the acceptance of a new definition of 'socialism' that differs greatly from the classic one.

If anyone is more interested in the "third way" (a fairly old idea, and not really just recently made up thing (Canadian traditions most closely [nearly uniquely] follow, and define this ‘third’ way), but definitely not encapsulated by that wikipedia quote posted earlier); read "Canadian Marxists and the search for a third way" by Peter Campbell (third way could be seen [broadly] as referring to “self-growth, towards a stronger, more equal society”, and it counters two other main ideas in the formational periods of Socialist ideas, one, “Marxist Evolutionism”- a belief, no, ‘faith’ that “Socialist Utopia is Destiny-whether ‘you’ act, or not”, as well as countering the more slippery ideas of “Syndicalism”, “disruption”, or “cog-stepping in” (syndicalism also relied on some degree of faith, that the resultant "torn down" society could reform, or be more equal, with little justification, I liken it to "ideological libertarianism" that is common in todays right. The third way is neither to wait for Godot’s Eutopia, nor to break the machine of civilization, and hope that the resulting order will be more egalitarian... It really goes back quite far to ideas such as “do actions matter”, or "is history destined" (it comes down on the side of earliest Canadian Conservatives [Social Responsibilities for those who 'have', to help those who 'have not']).
In order to understand the designation of the thrid way, it is neccessary to look at the history of Marxist thought and the development of Marxist-based organizations following the demise of the First International (1864-76), during the period of the Second International (1889-1914), and the Third or Communist International organized in 1919. The major Marxist tendency of the Second International period was the development of mass-based parliamentary socialism, whose leading spokespersons tended to identify working-class self-emancipation with the workers voting themselves into power by electing representatives to bourgeois-dominated legislatures.

The largest socialist party in Europe was in Germany, where the Social Democratic Party had not only survived but flourished under Otto von Bismarck's anti-socialist laws in the years 1878-90. The continued growth of the party, and increasing electoral success, produced a dominant leadership group which dedicated itself to not antagonizing the military and business leaders of Germany, sought to avoid mass action, and believed taht the triumph of socialism in Germany was inevitable. The growth of the party became an end in itself for many German Social Democrats, and revolutionaries such as Rosa Luxemburg criticized party leaders for their “organizational fetishism.” Most party leaders were characterized by what Roger Fletcher calls political “immobilism,” the belief that “nothing precipitate must be done to provoke the bourgeoisie into repressive action against the cherished party organizations”. 

In effect on the eve of the First World War, the idea of working-class self emancipation had been almost entirely subsumed under the necessity of always acting for the good of the party as defined by the leadership, including supporting Germany’s entry into the war. Opponents of political immobilism and Germany’s involvement in the war, notably Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, found themselves very much isolated as constant defenders of the idea of working-class self-emancipation.
....
Ernest Winch typified what was best in Marxism of the thrid way. He always kept in view the end of the capitalist system and the creation of a socialist society in which the needs of all would be met. He realized that this society had to be created by the workers themselves - it could not be given to them. Throughout his life he attempted to educate the rank and file, to bring them to a realization of their class position and what they had to do to change it. He was a social democrat in the best sense, a man who cared for the poor, the dispossessed, the exploited, the imprisoned, and the ill - all those he felt had been victimized by a system over which they had no control.
If that passage doesn't hit home the "everything that happens has happened before, and will happen again" buttons...

syzygy, I feel like you're trying very hard to argue that there's no way whatsoever that any policy Obama or the Democratic Party has ever espoused could possibly bear any resemblance whatsoever to socialism.

I mean, I agree that Tony Blair, perhaps the embodiment of the Third Way, was pretty much only a socialist inasmuch as the Labour Party Constitution declared him to be one and he found himself obliged to make a speech using the words "redistribute the wealth" every year. This doesn't, however, mean that Blair had nothing to do with socialism. Supposedly, the defining moment of New Labour was when Clause Four of the party constitution was changed (this was Blair's doing). Guess what sentence got added by New Labour? "The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party." Did New Labour mean it? Well, the cynical among us would say no, it was a way of trying to appease the left wing of the party. But the point is that they're coming out of an explicitly socialist tradition. 

Ditto for Gerhard Schroeder, except that some of the left wing of the SPD walked--that's where half of the Linkspartei came from (the other half was the remnants of the SED successor party). (Hell, that's even how Merkel became Chancellor the first time around. They both refused to form a coalition with Die Linke. A CDU/CSU-Linke coalition would have been weird, but SPD-Linke is totally plausible, but Schroeder refused. Presumably because it would have cemented Linke as a 'real' party, but I assume he was also a bit pissed at the people who left SPD.

Er.. to clarify, they rewrote Clause Four significantly. The 'democratic socialist party' sentence is the new first sentence. It wasn't there before (I don't know if it was elsewhere in the constitution).

Maybe the tail end of a thread with more than 7600 comments wasn't the best place to start this discussion :) But the questions have been on my mind quite a lot, lately.

hoyland: I feel like you're trying very hard to argue that there's no way whatsoever that any policy Obama or the Democratic Party has ever espoused could possibly bear any resemblance whatsoever to socialism

Honestly, I'm trying to work it out. I've done some quick reading up on the Third Way, and plan to do some more. Interestingly, to summarize, rightists call it socialism in disguise, while real / traditional socialists call it capitalism in disguise. Third Way-ists seem to want to call it a compromise between the two systems.

Interestingly, leftists say it's an idea that was introduced from the center-left in order to make it palatable to the left, and that it's basically taken over the left; that a left-of-Third-Way movement needs to stand up and create a new, 'real' left. You might say the same about rightists - think tea party zealots who talk about RINOs, Republicans who are too moderate, and who need to be replaced with 'real' rightists.

But back to the point about the meaning of 'socialism.' Even Third Way-ists talk about 'traditional socialism' and 'modern socialism,' that is, they distinguish what they call 'socialism' from what it has traditionally meant. Socialists disagree, saying the Third Way has falsely co-opted the term in order to confuse the issue.

I'm inclined to agree with the socialists on this one - I see no reason why the term should be redefined at the whims of the Third Way-ists. As such, and in the absence of any policies that seem to conform to the traditional definition of the word, I see the shrill cries of 'socialism' by the right (as a label applied to any economic policy they disagree with) as illegitimate. I'm willing to have my mind changed, though.

Until I do, I'll continue to blow conservatives' minds by showing them the traditional definition of the word and arguing that there's very little that meets that definition in present-day Western Europe or the US. I like to sew discord and chaos inside their fantasy bubbles by forcefully and convincingly challenging the false narratives they're spoon-fed by right-wing demagogues every day.

I don't disagree. I think I'm in a weird in-between space on this one. On the one hand, I do think the right has decided calling anything and everything they disagree with 'socialism' not because the particular thing they hate this week has anything in particular to do with socialism, but because 'socialism' is a dirty word. But on the other hand, I feel like, by trying to distance ourselves from socialism (whatever we decide to define it as), we're just buying into the idea that socialism is dirty or inherently evil and that's something I firmly disagree with.

hoyland: I feel like, by trying to distance ourselves from socialism (whatever we decide to define it as), we're just buying into the idea that socialism is dirty or inherently evil and that's something I firmly disagree with.

I understand where you're coming from. I'm not taking a moral position on socialism with this argument. I've had the opportunity recently to engage with some conservatives who don't go completely aggro when discussing politics and economics. I've found that some of them are receptive to sound, reasonable arguments based on fact, and it seems that bursting these little falsehoods that they're being fed is a way to at least get them to start engaging their critical thinking faculties a little more when listening to their favorite sources of information.

I find that pointing out lies and contradictions coming from the right is a way to help some of them out of zombieland a bit. If I can convince a certain type of conservative that 'socialism' is the wrong label for obamacare, for instance, he may be inclined to give less credence to Glenn Beck, if Glenn Beck calls obamacare 'socialism' over and over. I'm trying to build carefully-crafted messages for the different types of conservatives I have the opportunity to engage. For the 'fiscal conservative,' I usually talk about the quality of life here in Austria, a generous welfare state, as opposed to Texas, where I'm from. I try to point out that the US doesn't really have any true socialist policies, and that no one's really floating any real socialist policies. Basically, I'm trying to explode the myths they're hearing, in hopes of getting them to turn their brains on.

For an analog, I have a toolchest of talking points when engaging with Evangelical conservatives. During the election, that included talking about Romney's Mormonism, and the hypocrisy of many Evangelical leaders who, during the primaries, refused to support him due to his Mormonism, then all did 180 degree turns to support him after he won the primaries. I'm not taking a position on Mormonism, itself, here. Rather, I'm pointing out the hypocrisy of the leaders these people are listening to.

I wonder whether there's a place or community online that's discussing these sort of issues, and is also building up resources to counter lies from the right - either long-term lies like the ones about socialism, or lies of the day, like ones about Benghazi.

Conservatives are people, too, and the ones who are at all reasonable will listen to rational arguments based on facts, and I'm hoping to do my part to cause a few of them to think more critically about what they're being told.

I think that the end of slavery could have been accomplished with less blood and less treasure. I am puzzled as to why this is somehow devil-horn worthy. Yes, we should have ended slavery, but I don't think I've heard anyone advocate (before, apparently, today) that we needed to kill people to do it or it somehow wasn't worthwhile."

Dumbest thing I've read in a long time. As if Lincoln got out of bed one day and decided to be mean to the plantation owners.

The Civil War was inevitable barring some huge change of heart among the southerners and that wasn't going to happen.

And you think Sherman's March was bad? How about the Middle Passage?

The Civil War was not a spat over states' rights that tragically led to a preventable conflict. It was about an evil empire based on slavery -- the fucking enslavement of fellow human beings -- that became traitors the moment they decided to secede. Yes, traitors.

If you agree that the first nuclear bomb on Hiroshima was necessary to crush the spirit of another evil regime, than Sherman's March was actually a humanitarian act. Every year the American Civil War dragged on was another year of de facto genocide against blacks, not to mention the young (mostly poor, natch) southerners who would be thrown into the meat grinder of war. Sherman wasn't some big ol' meanie, he was highly conscious of the fact that he needed to make an example of Atlanta so that he could actually spare other major southern cities the same fate. (And it worked brilliantly.)

Both sides do it? Really? I'll grant that certain sectors of the northern economy profited from slavery and deserve blame as well but c'mon, this is straight up Glenn Beck-level bullshit.

And as klang pointed out, the South shot first. They were welcome not to.

What the Case for Palin in 2016 Says About Conservatives

A response to the LATimes op ed about running Palin in 2016 that was posted earlier.
Likewise, when it comes to winning over less wealthy voters, Allen seems to think they are all suckers. Allen enthuses, “Hardly anyone could be more blue collar than Palin, out on the fishing boat with her hunky blue-collar husband, Todd.” Hardly anyone, that is, except for someone who is actually blue collar. “Blue collar” workers are those who perform manual labor that does not require a bachelor’s degree: janitors, firefighters, auto workers, plumbers. Palin is a college educated multimillionaire. Before going into politics she was a local TV sportscaster. Palin was not even raised in a blue collar family. Her father was also a college educated professional, a school teacher. Palin is upper class and white collar.

Allen’s false assertion about Palin is revealing. For many conservatives, class is not determined by objective measurements such as income, occupation or education. Rather it is a set of cultural affectations. If you fish and can’t name a single newspaper you read, you’re blue collar, since “blue collar” is, in this usage, just a shorthand for what conservatives deem to be a typical white American.
TL;DR: Just because Palin is a woman with a daughter who is a single mom and a son who is a war vet and she knows some gay people, that doesn't mean voters can be hoodwinked into accepting Republican positions.

I think things like this should be tied around their candidates' necks and cause them to drown politically. There should be a wiki out there somewhere that just records all the terrible things they do, and it should become the first place people look when they want to find out if a person is really worth voting for. Not Wikipedia itself, although ideally it'd have its policy towards sources, but a place where it's okay to be really snarky about what a politician has done. No matter if they have an R, D or I after their name.

For what it's worth: Sherman's March was one of the greatest moments in United States military achievement, if not the greatest moment. I genuinely believe it was an incredibly turn for the better in modern warfare. Fewer people died in that march than almost any other campaign in the Civil War; and it was instrumental in ending the war quickly through means that didn't include simply slaughtering people senselessly.

William Tecumseh Sherman was a hero. If he hadn't done what he did, millions more would have died in bloody battle. The idea that burning down buildings is worse than slaughtering thousands by the minute is really strange to me.

It is, though, perhaps worth asking why everyone else (where everyone = "European colonial powers", mostly) managed to abolish slavery without a war. Only Brazil took longer than the US. Superficially (this is something I don't know much about), Brazil's economy was enormously dependent on slave labour, in the same way the southern US was. But surely if you were a British slave owner in the Caribbean, you took a big economic hit at abolition and it's not like people who profited from the slave trade in the Caribbean weren't politically influential people. This is something I know very little about though. (I mean, I know a bit about William Wilberforce, but that's because he's from Hull and there aren't that many historically significant people from Hull.)

Slavery is unfortunately such a huge evil that I think it makes people see it in a light that is different than any other. Many good, kind, peaceful people will justify some of the worst excesses and butchery, on the grounds that it stopped or was intending to stop slavery. Sherman, John Brown, Nat Turner, and many others are whitewashed of their crimes. In some ways it's a reasonable emotional response, because the scope of slavery is so vast and awful that it seems to outweigh anything that could have been done to oppose it.

But that kind of cult of relative evil can be really dangerous, particularly when it comes to justifying war crimes. Sherman is admired and respected in many present-day military circles.
"War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those who brought war into our country deserve all the curses and maledictions a people can pour out."
It is Sherman's words, on modern lips, often with accreditation, that preface the free-fire zones of Iraq, the revenge at Haditha, depleted uranium in the siege of Fallujah, "drop weapons", prisoner abuse, and a host of other ills. 

It's also interesting, because you can often see the same responses on the lips of people who have committed these actions or who are justifying them. "We liberated the people from Saddam Hussein, anything we did pales in comparison to what he did" is not radically different from "We liberated the slaves, anything we did pales in comparison to slavery." And, likewise, the very suggestion that we could have done things differently, without the massive casualties and devastation, meets with a very strong response. But in both cases, it may be unjustified. It doesn't mean that we are endorsing Saddam Hussein's crimes if we say that we should not have invaded Iraq and should have found another way of dealing with them. It doesn't mean we are endorsing slavery if we say we should not have gone to war with the South, and should have found another way of dealing with them. It means we are looking at what happened and evaluating it in hindsight, finding better hypothetical ways of dealing with the past so that we can find better ways of dealing with the future.

It's possible that that's becuase a lot of the enlisted men in the Union Army were comparatively recent Irish immigrants who didn't have as much nationalist sentiment yet. Some did enlist to "prove themselves" as Americans, yes, but others may have enlisted to sort of "train themselves" with an eye towards a future Irish rebellion back in Ireland, and still others were just drafted.

I've also heard accounts of Irish soldiers in the Confederate Army as well, and heard anecdotes of the Irish brigades stationed on either side of a river, loudly singing Irish rebel songs together at night.

There's a quote from General Sherman that sums up the military aspect of the Civil War, and the man himself, incredibly:
You people of the South don't know what you are doing. This country will be drenched in blood, and God only knows how it will end. It is all folly, madness, a crime against civilization! You people speak so lightly of war; you don't know what you're talking about. War is a terrible thing! You mistake, too, the people of the North. They are a peaceable people but an earnest people, and they will fight, too. They are not going to let this country be destroyed without a mighty effort to save it… Besides, where are your men and appliances of war to contend against them? The North can make a steam engine, locomotive, or railway car; hardly a yard of cloth or pair of shoes can you make. You are rushing into war with one of the most powerful, ingeniously mechanical, and determined people on Earth — right at your doors. You are bound to fail. Only in your spirit and determination are you prepared for war. In all else you are totally unprepared, with a bad cause to start with. At first you will make headway, but as your limited resources begin to fail, shut out from the markets of Europe as you will be, your cause will begin to wane. If your people will but stop and think, they must see in the end that you will surely fail.

It is Sherman's words, on modern lips, often with accreditation, that preface the free-fire zones of Iraq, the revenge at Haditha, depleted uranium in the siege of Fallujah, "drop weapons", prisoner abuse, and a host of other ills. 

The people who hold this view of Sherman's statement in his "Letter to the City Fathers of Atlanta" signal their own lack of understanding of Sherman's strategy and their shallow view of American history, Civil War history, and the history of warfare itself.

Indeed, in Sherman's own words, he recommends "curses and maledictions," even in 1864 far from the height of military technology.

On September 2, 1864, the mayor of Atlanta surrenders, under the terms of "protection to non-combatants and private property." Sherman accepts, and two weeks later orders "the burning of all public buildings, machine shops, depots, and arsenals in Atlanta, and sent word to the city to evacuate all citizens." The city fathers protest, saying that there are mostly civilians, the weak, the old, women, children in the city, with nowhere to go, and the evacuation would be a hardship.

Sherman replies:
I have read it carefully, and give full credit to your statements of the distress that will be occasioned, any yet shall not revoke my orders, because they were not designed to meet the humanities of the case, but to prepare for the future struggles in which millions of good people outside of Atlanta have a deep interest. We must have peace, not only in Atlanta, but in all America. To secure this, we must stop the war that now desolates our once happy and favored country. To stop war, we must defeat the rebel armies which are now arrayed against the laws and Constitution that all must respect and obey. To defeat those armies, we must prepare the way to reach them in their recesses, provided with the arms and instruments which enable us to accomplish our purpose. Now I know the vindictive nature of our enemy, that we may have many years of military operations from this quarter; and, therefore, deem it wise and prudent to prepare in time
His goal in the burning of Atlanta is the end the capability of the South to make war. Not brutalize the inhabitants. Not maim, burn and kill. But to destroy the South's industrial and logistical base, to which Atlanta is vital. In the very same paragraph you quote he continues:
Once admit the Union, once more acknowledge the authority of the national Government, and, instead of devoting your houses and streets and roads to the dread uses of war, I and this army become at once your protectors and supporters, shielding you from danger, let it come from what quarter it may.

Indeed, Sherman is even more explicit:
the only way the people of Atlanta can hope once more to live in peace and quiet at home, is to stop the war, which can only be done by admitting that it began in error and is perpetuated in pride.

We don’t want your negroes, or your horses, or your houses, or your hands, or any thing that you have, but we do want and will have a just obedience to the laws of the United States. That we will have, and, if it involves the destruction of your improvements, we cannot help it.
He even counters the revisionism that had been occuring during the war by the media in the South:
I repeat then that, by the original compact of Government, the United States had certain rights in Georgia, which have never been relinquished and never will be; that the South began war by seizing forts, arsenals, mints, custom-houses, etc., etc., long before Mr. Lincoln was installed, and before the South had one jot or title of provocation
Sherman answers the city father's claim that Atlanta is home to civilians by talking of the evacuated and starving civilians he'd seen in Kentucky and Missouri, fleeing the Confederate Army. The Union fed them. He answers the Atlantan's claim they thei do not help the war effort:
Now that war comes home to you, you feel very different. You depreciate its horrors, but did not feel them when you sent car-loads of soldiers and ammunition, and moulded shells and shot, to carry war into Kentucky and Tennessee, to desolate the homes of hundreds of thousands of good people who only asked to live in peace at their old homes, and under the Government of their inheritance.
He ends the letter with another offer: "But, my dear sirs, when peace does come, you may call on me for any thing. Then I will share with you the last cracker, and watch with you to shield your homes and families against danger from every quarter"

From the analysis:
Few people bother to read famous documents, and so few people actually read the text of Sherman’s letter, and so most people believe it expresses a callous or gleeful attachment to war. They think it is Sherman saying, Screw you, rebels—I’m coming for your women and children and you can all burn! The fact that the town leaders refused to evacuate when given the chance meant that there were civilians in Atlanta when it was burned, and there was loss of life. Some vindictive Union soldiers without personal integrity or honor were allowed to set fire to private homes with women and children in them both before and during the official destruction. But the fact that all loss of civilian life could have been prevented was conveniently overlooked by later southern historians, who simply focused on the carnage and helped create the image of Sherman as a south-hating demon whose memory must be reviled in perpetuity.
The people who fall for the revisionist history of the March To The Sea are, by and large, 'useful idiots.' Those who perpetuate it are worse.

In fact, the major text that makes the same comparison that you did, corb, gets the basic facts wrong.
Mr. Reston is unsparing in his moral censure, speaking (the words are his) of Sherman's sins, his crimes, his villainy, his uncontrolled brutality, his atrocities.

That would be a fair judgment if Sherman's army had left behind a trail of civilian corpses and ravaged women. But it did not, and that fact imposes a considerable strain on Mr. Reston's Vietnam analogy.

I was about to respond, but the man of twists and turns did so better than I ever could. The upshot: Sherman saved lives.

And it should be noted that Sherman wasn't as roundly reviled by Southerners as we are led to believe. One of my forebears was a certain General Johnston of the Confederate Army. At the surrender he introduced himself to Sherman and thanked him profusely; and for the rest of his life he revered and respected Sherman for being intelligent enough to see a way to end the war without bloodshed and calculating enough to bring it off. In fact, when Sherman died, Johnston was a pallbearer at his funeral; it rained, and Johnston caught the pneumonia that finally killed him, too. But he made it clear to everyone he knew: Sherman's tactics were the tactics of mercy. I get the impression that plenty of Confederate military men felt the same, and had an admiration for Sherman that was genuine.

Yes, I think that the blood spent in subduing one half of the United States and turning brother against brother was absolutely a waste. 

Isn't this essentially saying that abolishing slavery was "absolutely a waste?" There is no way the 13th amendment gets passed without the war.

I think that the end of slavery could have been accomplished with less blood and less treasure.

It seems to me the ideas that the CSA would have ended slavery on their own soon after secession are the most egregious and fallacious fantasies of neo-confederate counterfactualism. The end of slavery should have been accomplished on moral grounds well before the 1860's, and if it had been there would have been no need for the war. But the South had no intention whatsoever of ending slavery; they were trying to expand it, and this probably lead to the Civil War more than anything.

"We at the South are an agricultural people, and we require an extended territory. Slave labor is a wasteful labor, and it therefore requires a still more extended territory than would the same pursuits if they be prosecuted by the more economical labor of white men."
-Jefferson Davis

Assuming the CSA were allowed to secede, if/when slavery became untenable in the South for economic reasons a good guess is it would have at best been replaced by a system of apartheid far worse than Jim Crow.

As it happened, the fate of freed slaves immediately after emancipation is one of the biggest tragedies of the Civil War rarely accounted for:

How the end of slavery led to starvation and death for millions of black Americans

Refugeeing Virginia Slaves

One Kind of Freedom: The Economic Consequences of Emancipation by Roger Ransom, Richard Sutch, p.53-54 (2001)
General Howard, Freedmen's Bureau, estimated that 25% of African-Am. lost their lives by the war.
Instead, Ransom/Sutch estimate that 1.6% of African-Am. died as a direct result of the war. [based on the 3.5M blacks in the CSA, this would come to around 56,000 civilian deaths. Howard's est. would be 875,000 d.]

Whites in Jamaica or Trinidad could hardly defend themselves against the British Empire of the 1830s. Hell, they probably couldn't defend themselves against their own slave populations without the assistance of the mother country.

The less obvious answer is that in other slaveholding areas where slavery was abolished, the abolishing government provided monetary compensation to slaveholders for their property loss - the same suggestion that has been considered by many here as a ludicrous one. The English Abolition of Slavery act of 1833, for example, explicitly provided 20 million pounds for that compensation, as well as providing a gradual transition by keeping former slaves in "apprenticeships" for a period of six years. So while there was still economic loss, the loss was cushioned. Some have said upthread that doing it that way would have kept slavery until much, much, later - but somehow England managed to do it thirty years earlier than us, and without a war. 

Yet for some reason (I am not quite sure why, and would certainly appreciate if someone else has data) that way was not favored by America. The only thing I could think of would be Puritan morality (the wicked must be punished) or perhaps a lingering distaste for the Southern aristocracy slavery allowed in the original, Northern colonies.

B) The war wasn't fought to free the slaves. The slaves were freed as a consequence of the war, which the south started and lost. Maybe if the south hadn't started the war and were willing to compromise on ending slavery, they might have gotten a better deal.

Umm... maybe this is just my cynicism talking, but I think it had something to do with the slaveholders fighting tooth and nail against anything that could conceivably lead to slavery being further marginalised. That's why we had the Missouri Compromise, as far as I know. That's even why we have a state of Maine and not a really big, two-part Massachusetts.

"The less obvious answer is that in other slaveholding areas where slavery was abolished, the abolishing government provided monetary compensation to slaveholders for their property loss - the same suggestion that has been considered by many here as a ludicrous one."

Glad to hear you support reparations. How much is the legacy of slavery worth to each African American now? 

"Some have said upthread that doing it that way would have kept slavery until much, much, later - but somehow England managed to do it thirty years earlier than us, and without a war. "

And without the Missouri Compromise, and without a direct dependence of half of England on slave agriculture and without a continent to expand to… 

But let's be clear: You are arguing that the Union should have paid off slave owners and that this would have prevented the Civil War. Please state your claims without the weaselry of "somehow" and tell us how you would have done it? Extra points if it at all resembles the actual history of the United States without delving into fantasies of alternate timelines in which ending slavery hadn't been hotly contested for roughly 100 years when Lincoln took office.

The south seceded and began a war before any such thing could be attempted or negotiated. Indeed, the south seceded and began a war when the only threat to slavery that Lincoln had actually proposed was not expanding it.

The south experienced immediate, total, and uncompensated emancipation because of the war, not the other way around.

Bleeding Kansas demonstrated that partisans on both sides were willing to kill in order to influence regulation of slavery in a single territory. The assault on Sumner on the Senate floor further undermined any hope of compromise. The initial cause of the war wasn't full emancipation, but abolition of slavery in American territories.

When slavery was abolished in the North at the turn of the century, it was done gradually with more respect for property rights in some cases. I guess the better question is why didn't the South choose to abolish slavery in the 1830's by whatever means was acceptable to them? Why did they find it necessary to fight a war to protect slavery thirty years later? Why, instead of working to abolish slavery, were they making arguments that slavery was not merely a necessary evil but a positive social good and that "slavery anticipates the benefits of civilization, and retards the evils of civilization"?

This really seems to blame the North for not effectively ending Slavery earlier, without taking into account the political power wielded by the South. 

Ta-Nehisi Coates discussed this back in January: 
During forty-nine of the seventy-two years from 1789 to 1861, the presidents of the United States were Southerners--all of them slaveholders. The only presidents to be reelected were slaveholders. Two-thirds of the Speakers of the House, chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee, and presidents pro tem of the Senate were Southerners. At all times before 1861, a majority of Supreme Court justices were Southerners....

Compromise between abolitionist and pro-slavery interests was American policy leading up to 1860. The Federal government dominated by Democrats repeatedly acted to both preserve slavery in the South and to allow for its adoption in some western territories. These compromises were unacceptable to pro-slavery Democrats in 1860, who walked out and nominated their own candidate, on a plank calling for the expansion of slavery in spite of Popular Sovereignty.

It doesn't mean we are endorsing slavery if we say we should not have gone to war with the South, and should have found another way of dealing with them.

Yeah, we tried. Between Lincoln's election in November 1860 and the beginning of February 1861, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas had seceded. On March 2, 1861, the US Congress passed the Corwin Amendment, which would have prevented Congress from abolishing slavery. Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. The Confederates fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Lincoln called up troops to suppress the rebellion. Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina seceded.

There were 4 million slaves in the south. There wasn't enough money to compensate southern slave owners for their 'property loss'.
...in 1860 American slaves, as a financial asset, were worth approximately three and a half billion dollars — that's just as property. Three and a half billion dollars was the net worth, roughly, of slaves in 1860. In today's dollars that would be approximately seventy-five billion dollars. In 1860 slaves as an asset were worth more than all of America's manufacturing, all of the railroads, all of the productive capacity of the United States put together. Slaves were the single largest, by far, financial asset of property in the entire American economy. The only thing worth more than the slaves in the American economy of the 1850s was the land itself, and no one can really put a dollar value on all of the land of North America. If you're looking to begin to understand why the South will begin to defend this system, and defend this society, and worry about it shrinking, and worry about a political culture from the North that is really beginning to criticize them, think three and a half billion dollars and the largest financial asset in American society, and what you might even try to compare that to today.

It ain't new, friend. It was around before Beck or Huckabee were born. It's part of the bitter old Southern mythology of the Civil War – a mythology that once was rooted in understandably pained bitterness, but which was generally fueled by about fifty years of popular entertainment obsessed with the Southern mythology, even as it was aimed at both Southern and Northern audiences. Watch Gone With The Wind, for example, which portray's Sherman's march as just about the most hideous and horrifying war crime in history.

corb: “It doesn't mean we are endorsing slavery if we say we should not have gone to war with the South, and should have found another way of dealing with them. It means we are looking at what happened and evaluating it in hindsight, finding better hypothetical ways of dealing with the past so that we can find better ways of dealing with the future.”

A lot of people have given answers to this – for example, that we totally tried, etc – but I don't know how much I agree with them. The United States at that point in time was a place in many ways obsessed with war; we'd just finished a very frothy westward expansion, and we were very happy to agitate for bloody battle in plenty of situations.

I really think the answer here is in Lincoln. There are many ways that Lincoln was brilliant, many ways in which he earns his place as the greatest President the United States has ever had; but this was one of his finest hours even in a presidency filled with great achievements. He worked very hard to hold back the Northern tide and even to stymie it in many ways, because he knew that a federal government ought not make war on its states. In fact, he lost some advantage as the war started because he forced the Union to wait until it was absolutely clear to all observers in every way whatsoever that the South had initiated agitation.

This is something that really can't be simplified if we want to really understand what happened. Lincoln was meticulous and incredibly careful in his speeches to explicate what he was doing and why; if you want a really good summary of the events leading up to the initiation of hostility and the North's response, probably the best place to start would be Lincoln's Address to the Special Session of Congress on July 4, 1861, in which he formally requested authorization of war powers. This was a tricky thing, since the Constitution neither gave procedures for states to leave the union nor gave provisions for its defense. But Lincoln, brilliant lawyer that he was, built a strong and miraculously convincing case for the position that prevailed, a position which I think should be kept in mind: the Confederacy was a group of criminals who stole federal and public property for their aims, and as such it was the federal government's duty to stop them and restore that property to its rightful owners.

Still, to hear the March to the Sea compared unfavorably to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in terms of morality is one I hadn't heard before, and the idea that someone thinks the war could have been avoided with a financial settlement just boggles my fucking mind.

Speaking of Stone Mountain, when as schoolchildren we were taken to the park's now apparently defunct "War in Georgia" exhibit it was called "The War Between the States."

The exhibit was a narrated map study of Sherman's Georgia campaign. The most impressive part to a kid who had seen The Battle of the Bulge too many times was the large relief map of the terrain of Georgia studded with colored lights to indicate troop positions and movements. The area of operations for each phase of the Georgia campaign was highlighted by overhead lights. Created before cheap computer control, it was really a triumph of the electro-mechanical era. I couldn't find any video of it, and that's a goddamn shame.

As the history of that campaign is always told from McClellan's perspective, I hadn't heard of Johnston until I was knee deep into it. Once I read up on his career I had a lot of respect for what he did in Virginia and Georgia. You come from good people.

I have family in Georgia, and I've been to the laser show at Stone Mountain (on Independence Day, no less!)

I went there this summer, while at a summer school. I think the organisers went to investigate Stone Mountain's potential for a program outing of the 'hike up a large rock' variety, discovered the laser show, had their minds blown and decided it was an Important Cultural Experience (with capitals), so off we went. I ended up watching the laser show with a German guy and the look on his face was priceless. I was alternating between thinking "Oh my god, this is not happening." and looking at the guy next to me, who I think said it was like something he'd expect to see on the Simpsons, not in reality. The laser show ends with what might best be described as an orgy of patriotism, where the most patriotic things they could think of are images of the Civil Rights Movement, the military and astronauts (we concluded this is because you could construe the space program as a military endeavour--or something). That's pretty damn awkward when you're projecting it onto a Confederate war memorial that the Klan were instrumental in building. I got asked to explain a lot of sort of awkward things about the US (like... why is every employee at the grocery store, gas station and cafeteria black), but that laser show was the most awkward, because none of the people from the US knew how to explain the Civil War in a way that could possibly explain Stone Mountain.

Yeah, Stone Mountain was a trippy experience for this Yankee boy who had never spent any appreciable time below the Mason-Dixon. Not knowing what to expect, my wife (then girlfriend) and I decided to play a punch buggy type game where we'd compete to see how many confederate flags we could spot. Within a few minutes of our arrival, however, we realized this was the equivalent to playing punch buggy with the rules relaxed to include any vehicle with four or more wheels.

The light show itself was certainly entertaining, and since it was July 4, there were plenty of fireworks as well. Quite a spectacle even before you consider the irony of spending a patriotic holiday at a park dedicated to men who turned against their country.

I can hear the post-laser show fireworks from my back porch, but I haven't actually been to the show since I was a teenager. I imagine it is pretty surreal for people from up north or overseas. I guess they don't close the show with Elvis' American Trilogy, anymore but it's still the part most people come to see I think. The last time I was the show, you could tell the locals from the out-of-towners because locals would still stand during "Dixie". 

There's a program on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block called Squidbillies. The headquarters of Adult Swim are in mid-town Atlanta, not far from the Georgia Tech campus. What people who haven't spent time at the northern end of I-575 in Georgia don't realize is that it's a documentary. For example, my business partner lives in Cherokee county which is at the northern end of I-575 in real life. In the cartoon the squids have a sign in front of their house that says "P-nuts & Hair-dos." On the way to my partner's house you pass a real sign in front of a gas station that says "Tax Preparation and Deer Processing."

I bring it up because I imagine that to people who aren't native or naturalized southerners, the Squidbillies version of the Stone Mountain Laser Show is how the real thing looks.

Although slavery was one of the smaller causes of the war...

Not according to Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, who said this in his Cornerstone Speech, delivered on March 21st, 1861 (emphasis mine):
The new constitution has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution African slavery as it exists amongst us the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the "rock upon which the old Union would split." He was right. What was conjecture with him, is now a realized fact. But whether he fully comprehended the great truth upon which that rock stood and stands, may be doubted. The prevailing ideas entertained by him and most of the leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the old constitution, were that the enslavement of the African was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically. It was an evil they knew not well how to deal with, but the general opinion of the men of that day was that, somehow or other in the order of Providence, the institution would be evanescent and pass away. This idea, though not incorporated in the constitution, was the prevailing idea at that time. The constitution, it is true, secured every essential guarantee to the institution while it should last, and hence no argument can be justly urged against the constitutional guarantees thus secured, because of the common sentiment of the day. Those ideas, however, were fundamentally wrong. They rested upon the assumption of the equality of races. This was an error. It was a sandy foundation, and the government built upon it fell when the "storm came and the wind blew."

And now the historical revisionism zombies have gotten to Tony Kushner:
The inability to forgive and to reconcile with the South in a really decent and humane way, without any question, was one of the causes of the kind of resentment and perpetuation of alienation and bitterness that led to the quote-unquote ‘noble cause,’ and the rise of the Klan and Southern self-protection societies. The abuse of the South after they were defeated was a catastrophe, and helped lead to just unimaginable, untellable human suffering.

l though slavery was one of the smaller causes of the war...

It depends on how you define war. Slavery is why the south seceded. It was not the primary factor in the Union's decision to take up arms. That was about quelling a reunion and maintaining the country as a whole. If the CSA had offered up a compromise in 1861 or 1862 that left slavery in the states where it currently existed with a commitment to not try to expand it to any new territories, Lincoln very well may have taken them up on the offer.

Death and the Civil War. "With the coming of the Civil War, and the staggering casualties it ushered in, death entered the experience of the American people as it never had before -- permanently altering the character of the republic and the psyche of the American people. Contending with death on an unprecedented scale posed challenges for which there were no ready answers when the war began. Americans worked to improvise new solutions, new institutions, and new ways of coping with death on an unimaginable scale."

Southern Democrats had an even sweeter offer with Douglas's Popular Sovereignty in 1960. They chose to walk out because it was not sweet enough. 

Sure, I will grant that the Marshall Plan probably did a better job of building bridges than the Radical Republicans did with Reconstruction, but that was 150 fucking years ago. The 21st century South is increasingly urban, multi-ethnic, integrated, and engaged in business intimately tied to the rest of the U.S. economy. Civil War revisionism strikes me as mostly a rationalization for the same white-flight dynamics you see northern cities.

I don't think this was possible. If the South thought it was possible that slavery could survive political minority in the Union, they wouldn't have seceded in the first place, because that was the situation they were already facing. The abolitionists weren't going to disappear; a promise wouldn't have changed the way the wind was blowing.

Slavery had some inherent attributes that made it a difficult economic system to sustain. Revolt and escape were big problems that encouraged draconian, ugly legislative countermeasures like the Kansas Black Laws and the Fugitive Slave Act. Escaped slaves and their allies/agitators could not be allowed to just cross a border and be free. For slavery to exist to the South's satisfaction, the North would not merely have to tolerate it, but cooperate with it. That wasn't going to happen.

(And even if the South had seceded peacefully, I think the total commitment to slavery doomed the CSA to collapse or war anyway because the problem of escape and revolt does not magically disappear. How does the CSA exert pressure on the US after that? How does what used to be treason not become an act of war?)

Then Romney refused to concede Ohio, but Obama has so many paths to victory that when Colorado was called like 5 minutes later, Romney said "Oh, fartknocker" and hurriedly wrote a concession speech. 

Then Romney ended up with 47% of the popular vote and then Santa tucked us all into bed with lots of good liquor and locally made cheeseburgers (or veggie burgers).

McCain on Rice was embedded towards the end of that dailykos link from Homunculus, but its the best, most succinct explanation of the hypocrisy of the Republicans that I don't think anything else needs to be said about it:
In 2005, Mr. McCain argued that Condoleezza Rice was qualified to be the next secretary of state, even though she testified that there were WMDs in Iraq.

“So I wonder why we are starting this new Congress with a protracted debate about a foregone conclusion. . . . I can only conclude we are doing this for no other reason than lingering bitterness at the outcome of the elections. . . . We all have varying policy views, but the President, in my view, has a clear right to put in place the team he believed would serve him best.” (The Senate floor)

The Myth of Second Term Failure. Excerpt:
Every second-termer since Dwight Eisenhower has had to reckon with the opposition party running at least one chamber of Congress, and yet few left the White House empty-handed. Some, like Eisenhower, simply passed items from their rivals’ wish lists. The Republican loss of Congress in 1954 reinforced Ike’s pragmatism. Today’s pundits like to reminisce about Ronald Reagan sharing drinks with House Speaker Tip O’Neill in the 1980s, but the original model of bipartisanship was Ike’s evening sessions (also lubricated) with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and House Speaker Sam Rayburn. Liberals managed to get Ike, a reluctant integrationist, to back a civil rights bill, which took steps (albeit baby ones) to stop racial discrimination in voting. Other laws, such as the 1958 National Defense Education Act, served both liberal ends like funding education and conservative ones like strengthening the cold war military. Never much of an ideologue, Ike seemed happy not to have to deal with his own party’s rabid right wing. Of course, handing over the policy reins to the opposition isn’t an option today. But there are other ways in which presidents can accomplish plenty in the face of a hostile Congress.

Houdini: A missetep in a campaign that was run pretty well otherwise? 
Houdini seems, by and large, the exception to the Obama 2008 campaign... and even then they where nimble enough to patchwork a working alternative on the fly. Orca however, crashed and nobody was flexible enough to salvage anything from it. Which was endemic of Romney's general inability to adapt to changing situations fast enough to be effective. It took him about 6 weeks to transition from a Primary campaign to a General Election campaign. and even then it was more to do with Obama having a bad day, and misreading his opposition's intentions. But even then, at no point did Romney ever lead in the Electoral College. the only question 3 weeks out from the election was going to be who won the popular vote... which is symbolic only. 
There is the super secret conspiracy theory that Obama threw the first debate just so attention and main money remained on the presidential race rather then the Senate, thereby allowing the democrats to retain control of the Senate against pre-election expectations. I don't buy the conspiracy, but I think the outcome was the same.
At the end of the day there is just a lot to point to from the Romney campaign, even from a non-partisan point of view (Romney is Winning!! Ohio is NOT going for Obama... etc etc) of just plain getting it wrong. The question at this point isn't why Obama won, but why he didn't win by a greater margin.

(and I still wish Santorum had won the primary and lost the election)

You should read that link. It's a pretty good read. For example
Obama's organizational advantage might have helped drive a 2.6 percent increase [PDF] in Democratic turnout over 2004. Republican turnout, meanwhile, dipped by 1.3 percentage points.
Note as well, that this happened before the 2012 campaign, and, so, presumably, served as an object lesson for a campaign that was well organized and paying attention. The article reinforces the fact that ORCA's failure is a symptom of the cluelessness of the Romney campaign.

Mitt Romney: A good man. The right fight. By Stuart Stevens, the man who helped him lose.

The whole op-ed really is a masterpiece of self-serving deceit: " ... I appreciate that Mitt Romney was never a favorite of D.C.’s green-room crowd or, frankly, of many politicians. That’s why, a year ago, so few of those people thought that he would win the Republican nomination. ... Nobody liked Romney except voters. ... Romney captured the imagination of millions of Americans. ... Republican ideals — Mitt Romney — carried the day."

But this is the best part:
"There was a time not so long ago when the problems of the Democratic Party revolved around being too liberal and too dependent on minorities. Obama turned those problems into advantages and rode that strategy to victory. But he was a charismatic African American president with a billion dollars, no primary and media that often felt morally conflicted about being critical. ..."

It is mildly interesting to look at the 2012 and 2008 Republican primary maps. 

Romney won (pop vote) 11 States in 2008, Santorum won 11 states this year, both candidates lost IA (the first to vote). There are only 3 overlaps (MN, ND, CO). Seems like both primaries where efforts towards finding someone other than who eventually ended up on the ticked. January 2007 McCain's campaign was broke 

Just comparing the primary states they respectively won (and I know this is no surprise) Santorum seems to have his strongest support in the SE spreading into central midwest/west where the strongest base of the Republican Party is. Looking at Romney's primary wins seem to suggest his core was split between regional loyalty (around Utah) and in States where Republicans have a uphill battle to compete nationally (MN, MI, ME, MA, NV).
So, I guess in many ways Romney was suppose to be the 'moderate' candidate. And he might have pulled that off if he hadn't had to pander so strongly to the GOP base and then keep changing his stances. I think a Socially moderate/liberal and fiscal conservative who didn't keep changing their positions every other week would be a tough candidate to beat... (and I guess Obama kinda fits that category in some ways).

But both McCain and Romney where suppose to be at least somewhat removed from the hard core conservatives and the primaries certainly tanked Romney's GE chance, and didn't do McCain much good because of all the running away from their prior positions. 
It's a real dilemma for the GOP. You can see the dysfunction at play. They are unable to get a "real conservative" past the primary because too many primary voters either don't believe one could win the presidency or they actually don't care for extreme right wing candidates, and they are unable to get a real moderate who will not tie themselves into a pretzel, because too many primary voters are locked in full on culture war mode, no quarter given. So we end up with these half assed candidates, who may well have personal moderate leanings but are unable to run on them as the far right wing has just too big a slice of the pie. 

fundamentally polices are important, but when it came down to it, above all else the reason I couldn't vote for Romney is 1 - he was too inflexible in responding to new situations 2 - he really came over as a entitled rich asshole. McCain genuinely seems to be a little unstable (plus showed monumental poor judgement in his VP candidate).

I doubt I would vote for him (flat tax, anti abortion), but someone like Huntsman(cap and trade, pro civil unions in Utah, immigration reform) I would actually listen to and take some positions seriously. Can you imagine a non hysterical debate between Obama and Huntsman just sitting in some comfy chairs with a beverage of whatever choice? It would put 3/4 of Americans to sleep, but it would be fantastic.

Interesting stats on contributions in 2012:

Google - Obama received 97% of donations
Apple - 91%
eBay - 89%

So this thread is still open, and seems the apropos place. Like many, I recently spent time with older family, being that time of year and all. Things I learned, or had reinforced:

1: The only possible reason anyone voted for Obama is because they like handouts. Everyone knows the economy is terrible and the Obama people lied about improvements (all the more devious for those improvements being deeply sluggish at best, I suppose) but they want the free handouts that come from it. Really, Obama voters want the economy to be terrible.

2: There has never been an election more terrifying than this past one.

3: Republicans really don't like it when you point out that the GOP demonstrably doesn't care about actual fiscal conservatism or responsibility and that if you really want to be serious about cutting spending, there's no avoiding Medicare and defense. It makes them uncomfortable and quiet.

4: It also makes them uncomfortable and quiet to say that you find it kind of amusing that at some point, "conservatives" decided that ecological conservation was a liberal pursuit, and how did they live with themselves agitating for their state DNR to take better care of its land, and it would be much more business-friendly just to sell the whole lot and let the market handle it.

In all, it made the Onion reporting on one of the main planks of the GOP strategy being to try to keep its elderly voting base alive till after the elections that much more grimly funny.

Yeah, pretty much.. and yet despite running in the primary he didn't carry a single state and bowed out right after New Hampshire. This article says the Obama team considered Huntsman to be the toughest general-election threat. Same article is a summery of an interview Huntsman did. He actually sounds kind of sane. A bit too heavy on States rights perhaps.. but he when talking about Republicans and Government spending: also drops things like "We weren't coming from a position of strength [in 2012]," he said. "We sounded like hypocrites talking about spending when that was all we did under George W. Bush."

So again, wouldn't likely vote for him, but if he had won the presidency I wouldn't go into it with a all encompassing sense of doom either.

A number of them do. There's definitely some cognitive dissonance at play in the contortions.

Rush Limbaugh (actually some understudy as he was on vacation) was on the car radio while I was getting a lift back to airport on Monday, and it reminded me strongly of the good rule-of-thumb statement that if you're not paying for it, you're not the customer but are the product being sold. The anger's a hook, a palliative for fear that's drumbeat-relentlessly pushed. The fear's not being sold (it's free!), but is pushed and spread as fertilizer to retain a good harvest of the actual product, which is of course impersonal numbers of ears for the advertisers (invest in gold as it doubles and doubles and doubles again!, an age-reversing vitamin mix, some sort of "get control of your horrible brat children!" program were the ones I most clearly remember). But as the field gets increasingly monocultured and overfarmed again and again, they have to use more and more fertilizer (so much fear. Most terrifying election ever. Ever!), and have to crank up the offered anger for the temporary relief. Even if it stopped tomorrow, it'll still take years for the soil to recover from the abuse.

Farming metaphors were on my mind due to the part of the country.

The Pirates Behind The Campaign To Fix The Debt

Obama to GOP: I'm done negotiating with myself
That’s what you’re really seeing in this “proposal.” Previously, Obama’s pattern had been to offer plans that roughly tracked where he thought the compromise should end up. The White House’s belief was that by being solicitous in their policy proposals, they would win goodwill on the other side, and even if they didn’t, the media would side with them, realizing they’d sought compromise and been rebuffed. They don’t believe that anymore.

Perhaps the key lesson the White House took from the last couple of years is this: Don’t negotiate with yourself. If Republicans want to cut Medicare, let them propose the cuts. If they want to raise revenue through tax reform, let them identify the deductions. If they want deeper cuts in discretionary spending, let them settle on a number. And, above all, if they don’t like the White House’s preferred policies, let them propose their own. That way, if the White House eventually does give in and agree to some of their demands, Republicans will feel like they got one over on the president. A compromise isn’t measured by what you offer, it’s measured by what the other side feels they made you concede.
God we have only been saying this for the last 4 years. Better late than never I suppose.

Since Democrats had the support of 80 percent or 90 percent of the best and brightest minds in the information technology field, it shouldn’t be surprising that Mr. Obama’s information technology infrastructure was viewed as state-of-the-art exemplary, whereas everyone from Republican volunteers to Silicon Valley journalists have criticized Mr. Romney’s systems. Mr. Romney’s get-out-the-vote application, Project Orca, is widely viewed as having failed on Election Day, perhaps contributing to a disappointing Republican turnout.

Yeah, "socially liberal" in this context is usually understood to mean, "not worked up over culture war issues." So, pro-choice, pro-pot legalization, not up for teaching creationism in schools, that sort of thing. Some of those things are fiscally conservative in themselves, such as ending (or at least narrowing the focus of) the Drug War. But most don't have a direct major fiscal impact.

Basically, it is the stance of the person who says, "I want low taxes, sure. But I'm not one of those CRAZY people who wants to ban books."

Hi, I'm your unicorn, and it's absolutely possible. Without giving you the laundry list, in general, I simply don't favor using the government to impose individual ideas of morality on other people. Thus, instead of being socially conservative, I'm socially liberal. However, I am still fiscally conservative - because not enforcing morality on people costs absolutely zero dollars more than we are already spending.

Plenty of socially liberal but fiscally conservative people up here in Canada -- the result is a Stephen Harper government that despite being considered extremely right wing by some on the left has in fact only kind of tinkered around the edges of social policies. Harper knows that any crazy social policy changes to abortion, same-sex marriage, etc would be the death of his majority government. 

What's stopping the rise of centrist, socially liberal but fiscally conservative parties in the US is not that such voters don't exist, but rather that the crazy primary system weeds out moderate candidates, particularly on the right. The extremist socially conservative voters have captured the GOP in the last two elections because they dominate the primary process by being more engaged than their moderate breathren. 

I would argue in fact that the America is fundamentally a 'conservative' country in a fiscal sense, and this is reflected by the general similarity between dems and repubs on fiscal issues -- we're really talking about marginal differences in income tax rates, not an establishment of a european style cradle-to-grave social welfare state. 

The GOP will be a contender in national elections again once they figure out how to rejig the primary process so that it is not dominated by the culture wars wing of their party.

Politics is, by its very nature, the actions of the polis, i.e. "government," enforcing some notions of morality on some individuals. Unless you live as a solitary hermit, you probably endorse the imposition of one or another moral idea on the community around you.

This is warped thinking that implies political beliefs exist only on one axis. It is entirely possible to dislike taxes and the deficit and entirely LOVE pot and the gays. Americans need to get away from this idea that politics is a binary choice.

In other countries, it is entirely possible to be a pro-gay anti-immigrant pot-smoking militaristic deficit hawk, because political views aren't treated as existing only as a binary choice between two groups of values. This binary belief in the US is even reflected in the media - "MSNBC vs FOX".

Good point, but what if you're the person who follows the studies that show it is cheaper for a nation to provide that safety net then deal with the fallout from not having one?
i.e. providing a level of welfare drastically reduces emergency situations, fringe desperation, and increases economic foundations of a society?

Because I still look at those things with an economically hawkish perspective, and find the social safety net to be a worthwhile on an economic level. Not solely, I like helping people too, but the numbers are good.

It starts to seem like "economically liberal" becomes a bit of a strawman, associating "liberal" with just tossing away money.
Both sides can be smart and look at the bottom line and scour the books for value, that's not a conservative principle. But what does differ is the possibilities we are open to in the process.

I think a government safety net for those in economically dire straits is crucial; people who are on unemployment/food stamps, for instance, put that money back into their communities by buying things like food and by not getting arrested for sleeping in doorways and by not having their kids put into the system because they don't have housing.

As Theta States alludes to above, there really is no fiscally liberal versus fiscally conservative axis to speak of in the U.S. Both parties run deficits, but in recent times, Democrats do a better job of controlling them. Both parties believe in a bloated defense budget, and both parties believe in Medicare and Social Security. The fact that one party also believes in Medicaid, food stamps, and other poverty assistance programs and one does not has nothing to do with fiscal conservatism.

The real axis on economic issues is Keynesian economics on the left and trickle-down supply-side economics on the right. There is simply no constituency for a focus on the deficit.

Fiscally conservative means maintaining the largely functional system that we have, taxing people at a sustainable level and investing in things that work. People who call themselves "fiscally conservative" would often be better described as "fiscally reactionary" or "fiscally revanchist."

So I suppose I should have asked, can anyone give a relatively unbiased and non-axegrindy definition of fiscal liberal and fiscal conservative? These things don't have to align with the two parties we happen to have in the US, because I think attempting to do so generally hampers those definitions.

Personally, I would tend to describe a fiscal conservative as someone who believes more benefit will be derived from less government spending overall, whereas a fiscal liberal is someone who believes more benefit will be derived from more government spending overall. In terms of deficits, I would define a fiscal conservative as someone who thinks reducing them is more important than short-term population benefits, while a fiscal liberal is someone who thinks reducing them is less important than short-term population benefits. (The old "This will be better in the long term/We're all all dead in the long term" debate) In terms of taxes, I would describe a fiscal conservative as someone who supports a lower level of progressivity in taxation and a fiscal liberal as someone who supports a higher level of progressivity in taxation. 

Again, I'm willing to admit there might be bias in my definition, but I'm looking for a better one that's defined in good faith, at least.

Incredibly it's really hitting home that the rot in the Right wing Epistemic echo chamber extends even beyond the media services and the gold-digging personalities (Limbaugh and his radio imitators, Coulter, Malkin, Brietbart websites and it's imitators, the wingnut blogs and community sites, the whole Murdoch firmament of newspapers and publishing and of course FOX news) who sqeeze it for vast wealth and unlimited media exposure, BUT (and this is key), into the professional services companies that support the various Republican candidates, even up to the actual GOP Presidential Nominee.

All along the Romney campaign struck me as a massive lumbering and ineffectual company that wasn't really getting the proper feedback on it's outward facing stance, and I think it had to do with what you could see was a bubble Romney was in where he was trying to do exactly as he was advised, but without any of the proper understanding of a situation, so he always seemed like he was an actor repeating th words in a script without any real understanding of why he was saying and acting the way he was...it wasn't really until his wife and Tagg basically took over the hands on handling of Romney, around the first debate, that it seemed that he trusted himself, because he trusted THEM. Whereas before he was like a guy driving a massive truck with a really loose steering wheel.

Which is all to say, fuck yeah, every single, political PR, Strategy, branding, polling and marketing agency tried to get a piece of the massive chunk of change the Romney campaign had on hand via Citizen's United and the Kochs and they basically cannibalized the Romney campaign into utter impotent imminent disaster....

Honestly, all that money?? Who's going to risk losing out a pay day like that by mucking up the machinery with the unfortunate truth of the matter.

I don't think Romney would've won anyway, but the whole group of parasitic organizations that were around that campaign were more into the feeding frenzy of all that money rather than real quantifiable goals. 

The irony of it all is that, it was supposed to be the private sector in one of it's finest moments helping to elect one of it's own true titans and prophets of the perfection of Capitalism and the Randian John Galtian spirit of true "genius."

Maybe, just maybe, there are more important and more effective ways of motivating people, other than only the money of self-proclaimed uber-menschen such as the Kochs and the Romney's and the Adelson's and the Texas Billionaires and all those folks who see themselves as the tip of the evolutionary spear, when in fact they're simply the tip of the gigantic-clusterfuck of right-wing Wall Street crony capitalistic oil company military industrial old-money, (whew) hubris??

whereas a fiscal liberal is someone who believes more benefit will be derived from more government spending overall.

I suggest that this is a fundamental misunderstanding of "liberalism," the sort of thing that leads conservatives to describe George W. Bush, in retrospect, as a "liberal." There may be people who believe that government spending is good purely as an end in itself, but that's not a very sophisticated understanding of either macroeconomics, government, or liberalism.

Broadly speaking, outside of specific contexts, I'm doubtful that abstract phrases like "fiscally liberal/conservative" mean much at all except as symbolic markers. I have no idea what "I would define a fiscal conservative as someone who thinks reducing [deficits] is more important than short-term population benefits" means practically. And I'm at a loss to what such phrases could mean to someone who doesn't even concede the necessity of government.

Personally, I would tend to describe a fiscal conservative as someone who believes more benefit will be derived from less government spending overall, whereas a fiscal liberal is someone who believes more benefit will be derived from more government spending overall.

As someone who started his political thinking as a Conservative but has come around quite a bit to the left, I don't think this is a good definition of what a fiscal liberal is. I think it's a good definition of what a conservative thinks a fiscal liberal is. I'd be inclined to say that a fiscal liberal is someone not opposed to spending a little more on prevention if it will prevent spending a lot more on cure. I'd say that your definition of a fiscal conservative is pretty accurate. (Which is to say, I know an awful lot of Conservatives who find reasons to oppose stitch-in-time sorts of government spending.)

Now, of course you may want to object to this definition because it makes the fiscal liberal seem, I think, more reasonable than the fiscal conservative in a way that is not just attributable to axiomatic preferences. To which I might say, "well, yeah, that's why I stopped being a conservative."

You think the Romney campaign could've somehow, if it was more effectively run, been able to do that? In retrospect (and going by Nate Silver's data) it seems simply not doable (Especially in regard to the clear lead in Ohio by Obama), although I admit, in the run-up I did think such a feat was possible given their gigantic wads of CU cash.

In these conversations, that seems like such an arbitrary thing to focus on. "less government spending overall"? Why focus on that of all things?
Shouldn't the focus be on efficacy and efficiency? The mere bottom line says nothing about results, growth, society, mortality rates, etc.

I think this might be an example of politicos having the wrong conversations, and thereby keeping us in our rut.

In the interest of hashing out this definition in good faith, I'll have a go at your other points as well:

In terms of deficits, I would define a fiscal conservative as someone who thinks reducing them is more important than short-term population benefits, while a fiscal liberal is someone who thinks reducing them is less important than short-term population benefits. (The old "This will be better in the long term/We're all all dead in the long term" debate) 

I kind of think that, to defend this position, you have to get into a no true scotsman sort of a position. Self-described Conservatives have not in my lifetime actually reduced the deficit. Now you can say that what you are describing is not aligned with any particular political position and that Republicans have actually been on the left on this issue. I'm not sure that's a satisfying place for you to be. I think it's accurate that Conservatives talk a great deal about short-term deficit reduction, but I don't see them doing much about it. 

(For clarification, I'm talking about the Bush years and to a lesser extent the Ryan plan. I'm not trying to be unfair here and I do get that you are trying to divorce your definition from the US political parties, but this is a kind of specific issue and I think it's worth looking at the specifics of how various -- admittedly imperfectly implemented -- political philosophies have actually affected the deficit. You can disagree that what I'm describing are indeed Conservatives, but this is a conversation that doesn't just happen in a vacuum.)

In terms of taxes, I would describe a fiscal conservative as someone who supports a lower level of progressivity in taxation and a fiscal liberal as someone who supports a higher level of progressivity in taxation. 

I'll accept that. Conservatives love ideas like a so-called "Flat Tax" or replacing the income tax with a sales tax, both of which are pretty deeply regressive. They also seem to like preserving preferential tax treatment on capital gains income, which I presume is fairly regressive.

Big_B: "What is their motivation? How in the world would cutting social security/medicare benefit them?"

In short: they're trying to sell it as a focus on the debt, but they really want tax cuts.

How Did ‘Fix the Debt’ Become ‘Protect the Bush Tax Cuts’?
And thus, Fix the Debt and its partners find themselves twisted in a knot. Because “comprehensive tax reform” is such a central component of their vision, they have to root for the Bush tax cuts, because there’s not much room for reform otherwise. But supporting the Bush tax cuts, as a baseline, is not “fixing the debt.” It’s the opposite, since the Bush tax cuts make up almost all of the long-term projected deficit, as this chart from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows:
CEO Council Demands Cuts To Poor, Elderly While Reaping Billions In Government Contracts, Tax Breaks
As part of their push, they are advocating a "territorial tax system" that would exempt their companies' foreign profits from taxation, netting them about $134 billion in tax savings, according to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies titled "The CEO Campaign to ‘Fix’ the Debt: A Trojan Horse for Massive Corporate Tax Breaks" -- money that could help pay off the federal budget deficit.

While a liberal, I would not sign up for the idea that I think more government spending is better. I would say that given the world we live in today, more government spending is necessary to achieve the goals I think the United States sould be pursuing. 

From my point of view, the fundamental fact for fiscal conservatives is that the existing distribution of goods and services is optimal, or at least cannot be improved by forces outside the market. I would happy to be the complement of that assertion.

Absolutely. Swinging 100K should not hard to do.

Obama's biggest problem was the mess he mostly inherited. 

Romney's biggest problem was himself. He didn't understand how the country had shifted and was insensitive to that. His outlook on the country was further thrown off by his own upperclass wall street like background. 

From reading the various after election reports, I get a strong sense that the Obama campaign and its volunteers worked their ass because they felt they were the fight of their lives and could not afford to lose. They knew they might lose, but damnit, it wasn't going to be from lack of trying.

Romney's campaign comes off as "our country is going in the wrong direction and its all Obama's fault and we have to fix that. And get our beaks wet too, you know?" Mitt didn't inspire people the same way Obama did. Which isn't a big thing in and of itself. Mitt probably could have won against Obama 8 years ago. But demographics have shifted and I suspect even beliefs. For example, he idea of keeping government out certain areas such as healthcare is slowly crumbling, just from necessity. 

I also think Obama is singularly unique candidate, in American politics, that is consistently under estimated. He doesn't fit the political mold, yet the mold keeps wanting to view him through its own lenses. This happens to both liberals and conservatives, who see what they want to see in him. The truth is that he has elements of both and usually itsn't too wedded to either if it means making some sort of half way decent deal. This manages to enrage the left and cause belittling from the right.

But it is, in my opinion, what we need more of. You get enough slices i.e. half decent deals and pretty soon you got a full loaf of bread. Mmm bread.

So one thing that's complicating this conversation is that since FDR, the term "liberal" in the United States means something fundamentally different from what "liberal" means in Europe, and what "liberal" meant before Roosevelt.

As I understand it, the older/European definition of liberalism focuses on freedom to do things — freedom to worship what you want, freedom to speak what you want, and so forth (today we can add freedom to smoke what you want, drink what you want, and love who you want to this list). In 1941 Roosevelt gave a very smart speech where he tied together these abstract freedoms-to-do-things with more concrete freedoms from certain things — freedom from starvation, freedom from exposure to the heat and cold and rain and snow, freedom from the fear of war — arguing convincingly that these freedoms-from-things are necessary for the earlier freedoms-to-do-things to be meaningful. 

In most of Europe (I'm an ignorant American here, so correct me if I'm wrong), the mantle of defending the freedoms-from-things has been picked up by social democratic parties, whereas in America they've been in large part tucked into the definition of liberalism. 

I agree with the idea that it's difficult to be a fiscal conservative (in the sense of wanting government to take in and spend as little money as possible, without regard to outcomes) and also a social liberal, in the sense outlined by FDR. I also agree with FDR that abstract freedoms-to-do-things are sort of a pale joke if most people aren't free from want and fear. Liberalism without an attempt to free people from want often ends up being reducible to defending the right of rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges.

Corb's idea of wanting to "shrink government" and of thinking of liberals as wanting to "expand government," without regard to the aims of government and without any reference to the idea that a representative democratic government is a servant of the people rather than an outside imposition on the people, is entirely specious and more than a little bit trollish. I'm comfortable saying this despite the fact that she has plenty of fellow trolls in the national media and the Republican party.

I think it comes down to this: There's a certain amount (quite a bit in fact) of money that needs to be spent by the government. Democrats think most of it should go to the betterment of the country and to deal with poverty and social justice. Republicans think that's a complete waste of time because it just creates dependence and "we own this country" and "we're the job creators" and "we're the REAL Americans who built this country" and to hell with everyone else, WE deserve that extra money in the form of our taxes being as low as possible.

That's it. That's the whole enchilada of this shitshow of a two party system, all this other stuff about "Fiscal Conservative" and debt and deficits and whatever else is put out there as being common sense is horseshit.

It's about the money. The money the government collects and WHO is going to get it. Throwing money at a situation causes waste and lousy results. It doesn't matter if it's the government doing it or the private sector. BOTH are susceptible to the same exact failures and organizational dysfunction. Both are susceptible to gross and extreme and horrible acts of injustice and human rights abuse. Only difference is government is supposed to never stop being of and for the people, and corporations inevitably act for an ever smaller group of privileged oligarchs.

I think a government safety net for those in economically dire straits is crucial; people who are on unemployment/food stamps, for instance, put that money back into their communities by buying things like food and by not getting arrested for sleeping in doorways and by not having their kids put into the system because they don't have housing. Like that.

This is actually a really great statement, and I appreciate it. I know you didn't mean to use this as a separating statement, but I think this is actually a fantastically well-spoken definition of the difference between what I would see as a social liberal and a fiscal liberal - and I wonder how other people who consider themselves liberal would feel about it.

To me the idea that government also needs to provide "freedom from starvation", "freedom from exposure", etcetera, is in fact absolutely the heart of fiscal liberalism, but again, being a fiscal conservative (but social liberal according to your "older/European" freedom-to definition), I'm not the most unbiased party. I'd certainly like to find a definition of fiscal liberalism that those who practice it could actually agree with.
posted by corb at 12:33 PM on November 30, 2012


I don't think that definition works, because in theory, someone can believe that people ought to be free from starvation, freezing to death, etc. but believe that those freedoms will naturally flow from shrinking the size of government so that the wealthy can donate more to charity. The further you get away from specific policy preferences and into the realm of beliefs in various freedoms, the more room there is to hide the ball and pretend there's more agreement than there actually is.

I think setting out with a goal of defining fiscal liberalism/conservatism is a fool's errand. The real axes are social issues and the role of government.

Well and so but anyway, the point is that one of the reasons why classical liberalism is wildly unpopular nearly everywhere is that espousing abstract freedoms to do things without also affirming concrete freedoms from denial of resources is an incoherent doctrine. In practice it's either pollyannaism ("let's just pretend that everyone already has the resources needed to be fully human and to exercise human rights and maybe everything will be okay") or outright deception ("we'll buy off the suckers by dangling rights they can't use and keep the goods to ourselves") — and most people who have actually experienced lack can see through it pretty quickly.

Drinking the Kool-Aid.

benito.strauss, I would say you're mistaken in equating a bare-bones welfare state with socialism. Now, I don't believe in shying away from the term, but as used in American politics it lately seems to subsume, well, one drop of social spending. Socialism per se is really about seizing the means of production and operating private enterprise for the benefit of the proletariat, and that only works if you believe all taxation is socialism. In the purest form, of course, socialism becomes communism, there is no more private property, and ownership is eliminated. But socialism as such really requires a direct intervention in the control of private property and wealth, which is really a stretch if you're only talking about a "safety net" (which is what conservatives call the bits of the welfare state they're willing to compromise on keeping).

A better term for what you describe is a mixed economy and social democracy. This essentially comprises most of the advanced economies, from the US to the EU to the G7 (Russia is a special case, naturally). Some of them, in technical terms, verge on socialism, but in practice mainly we're talking about capitalist economies with a large welfare state aka government sector.

Do I still have to when smarter and more eloquent people have done so between my prior comment and this one? "Socially liberal and fiscally conservative" is nearly always code for "I believe we shouldn't let babies starve, but keeping my money is more important."

And I completely agree it actually makes more fiscal sense to prevent rather than respond, and in that way social programs are often the fiscally more coherent positions (which I agree with). But they're like medication for a mental condition: It's very easy to believe, while you're on the medicine, that you're healthy..."why should I keep taking this? I'm fine!" But the only reason you're fine is because you take your medicine. "Why should we fund all of this preventative medicine? Hardly anyone gets sick any more!"

One more fussy distinction to consider is the difference between social democracy and democratic socialism. The former aims to gradually reform the economic system toward socialism through the tools of electoral democracy, whereas the latter aims to do the same and has the same respect for the will of the people, but without the faith in the ability to get to socialism/economic democracy through parliamentary means.

Not that it matters, but the only political party on this continent that I entirely agree with is Canada's NDP, which is more or less social democratic but with a democratic socialist element on its left wing.

Hey, at least you're not one of those Tea Partiers who think socialists are the ones who are going to take away their Medicare!

Worth remembering as well is that John Maynard Keynes saw expansive government intervention in the economy as saving capitalism from itself, and to a certain extent John Kenneth Galbraith explained the income tax the same way (see the NYT 'A Liberal Moment' link above). These were men who believed in entrepreneurial capitalism, who believe in the motivational power of profits, and neither of them wanted to see a society that crushed the lowest strata to a pulp because they would probably rise up and replace the entire economic system. Various terms have been bandied about for this sort of thing including humane capitalism.

"Socially liberal and fiscally conservative" is nearly always code for "I believe we shouldn't let babies starve, but keeping my money is more important."

I don't think that's quite fair. I have been deeply involved in local politics recently (Wisconsin/Walker/etc.) and have met quite a few traditional Obama voters -- pro-labor, pro-choice, pro-gay-rights, and all of that, but who are absolutely stone-cold terrified of the national debt. Most of them are older and retired, if that matters. These are persuadables from a GOP point of view. For the most part they remain in the D column because they want the welfare state "fixed", just by one of their own (like Clinton and welfare reform). But what makes them tricksy, so to speak, is that for many the only thing keeping them off the R reservation is that so many GOP candidates lately are so awful. Hewing to my Wisconsin milieu, Paul Ryan has been so successful here because that fiscal conservative line sells these older voters like crazy, and he's quite careful about crowing his social conservative voting record. With a hyperactive street game OFA and ourselves were able to cut his usual 20-point electoral margin in half, but then again only in half -- and his district is largely the district that was represented by Les Aspin for many years. So I think I have a bit of a handle on these voters.

The discussion I see here is pretty broken because American political parties are broken. In parliamentary systems there are much more obvious homes for such voters rather than one or the other that offends half of a voter's soul. I don't know what polls say, lately, but I think this type of voter is very real and much more numerous than some seem to think.

My point in saying "show your work" wasn't idle snark. It is not obvious, to me anyway, that social liberalism and fiscal conservatism are fundamentally incompatible. If you can show this is the case then it would help advance the conversation, if you can't, then this should be made evident.

I agree with JHarris. The cost savings of disassembling the prison-industrial complex created as a result of the drug war is clearly huge, but I've never seen an estimate of the savings. This is the kind of thing that a fiscally conservative, socially liberal person wants. Is there a party forwarding this agenda? I would like to know about it.

Part of the problem is that the words "liberal" and "conservative" are removed from their roots in a way that means everyone gets to decide what shades of nuance they want their particular phrasing to fall under — and there are professionals out there working to make idioms even further abstracted from any coherent meaning. 

So, in a rational, common-language sense, the "conservatism" should be opposed to change irrespective of current mores, and we've had a good half century of a vision of citizenship that's based on shared reward for shared sacrifice. Conservatism should be conserving that. Instead, what's presented as "conservative" actually means dismantling the infrastructure we've built to support that shared vision of citizenship, tied to actually conservative religious and social views (place of women, gay marriage, etc.). Social conservatives are, honestly, conservative. Fiscal conservatives aren't, unless you discount the 20th Century and want to conserve us right back to the 1800s. 

The "liberal" part really really doesn't make sense either; "neo-liberal" or "libertarian" is much closer to "liberal" than the modern epithet. The only way the common usage works is "liberal" like "profligate" (i.e. "free" as in "free spending"), and that only works if you've assumed your conclusion that government spending is inherently wasteful. (It's not, generally.)

Because of that, egalitarians (more often, "progressives") are more conservative than libertarians, who are radical (they want to create change under which current society could not function) and the current G.O.P. is certainly revanchist — they want to retake lost territory. 

(Part of the problem is that social conservatives and economic revanchists both form minorities on their own, and do have a fair amount of overlap — many of the economic revanchist schemes involve removing safety nets that decrease inequality, including gender and racial inequality.)

To steal a concept from Milton Friedman, the difference between conservatism and liberalism when it comes to the public purse, is a matter of their attitude to political instrumentalism. In liberalism, money is not really an end in itself, it is only useful as a tool to deliver real benefits (e.g. food, schooling, roads) to human beings. Basically, the liberal attitude to money is that it't not a thing in the same sense that a chair, or a flower, or an overcoat, are things. Money is transactional short cut, making the movement of a thing from where it originates to where it is needed. Money is a part of the system, but it has no value outside the system.

In conservatism, however, money has inherent value (in philosophical terms, not in the sense that 10 dollars will buy five large cups of coffee at Starbucks). Money is earned, not just in the sense of you get paid for your work, but the money you receive is a sign of moral value. People should get the money they deserve. Thus, as opposed to the liberal view, where money is amoral (not immoral, but rather without moral value), money is a moral good. So when money is removed from a person by coercion, you aren't merely taking money, you are taking someone's self worth. From this flows the idea that only things judged to be of high moral worth should receive tax money.

So, when it comes to fiscal issues, the liberal looks on money as an instrument to bring relief to those who want the basic necessities of life, but the conservative sees money not as an instrument, but as sign of human worth.

I realized, writing all this out, that my picture of conservatism is basically a crude kind of Calvinism, which I suppose isn't too surprising given its huge influence on American religious life.

A person who makes more money than you is better than you, and therefore beyond criticism. This is called The Worthington Law, and it's used to gauge the value of human worth.

JHarris, I don't think we're going to be able to hash this out here to any sort of mutually acceptable conclusion. As has been discussed many times above, we cannot even agree what "fiscally conservative" means, nor "socially liberal."

For example, I could easily label myself "fiscally conservative" if that meant "government should spend money wisely." Who wouldn't agree to that? But in my world, wise spending of money would mean continual maintenance and improvement of existing infrastructure, vastly increased spending on education, a basic stipend and housing for everyone, fully socialized healthcare, government investment in research and science, championing environmental causes...and on and on. "Fiscal conservatism", to me, would also mean halting stupidity like the "war on drugs", the vast over-spending on defense, government spying on citizens, our subsidizing rich corporations...and on and on.

This is not what anyone I have ever met who claims to be "fiscally conservative" is talking about. They inevitably talk about making government smaller and paying less taxes (even if they effectively pay no taxes at all). 

Likewise, in my experience, people who claim they're socially liberal in conjunction with "fiscally conservative" are often using the term as a way to say "hey, all that moronic woman-hating, gay-bashing and religious stuff that the politicians who (claim they) are in our fiscal camp often support? That's not me."

Social progress is expensive, but the lack of social progress is even more expensive. Government is the only way to achieve social progress; we have seen that the "free market" is absolutely abysmal at anything related to human rights.

This turns out to be not as hard as you might think. Silver is a bit shy about exactly what he's doing -- which isn't crazy or assholish since that's his livelihood -- but from what I can tell his models are actually very simple.

What Silver has been extraordinarily good at is presenting his results in ways that make sense to laymen, and explaining more or less how his model works in ways that make sense to laymen. Which is, to quote Biden, a big fucking deal.

Romney's best debate lines during the primary came when he was under pressure. I think he wanted to wait to respond to all the Bain/elitist/47% stuff until Obama came at him on it during the debates so he could do it when everyone was watching.

The problem was Obama was (and Cutter knows this) smart enough never to tee him up for that kind of thing. On 47%, Romney had to wait until a town hall question that didn't even apply and gave Obama the last word on the subject to tear apart his defense.

The primary opponents sensed his inevitability and had to go all out guns blazing, Romney never quite realized it was Obama that was now inevitable and that he should have been on the offensive rather than triangulating.

But that sort of thing only goes so far, especially on a national stage.

Jindal is, in addition to being a religious nut, a wonk with no personality, a screechy voice, and the personal presence of a 14-year-old gamer. It's hard to see at this point who the Dem candidate will be in 2016, but considering the roll the Dems are on it would be amazing if it isn't someone who would simply wipe the floor with Bobby Jindal.

I tried the Nate Silver blog and got blocked (so they are counting blogs against your total), deleted the extra parameters again, and was able to read the whole blog.

But I'm sure that was some kind of anomaly. I mean, what are the odds that trick would work again?

Nate Silver bashes Politico. Excerpt:
In the interview Friday, Simmons said Politico’s criticism seemed “passive aggressive,” like they “couldn’t really figure out a good way” to go after Silver.

“Politico is … it’s like ‘Who won the day?’ kind of thing, right?” Silver responded. “They’re trying to cover it like it’s sports, but not in an intelligent way at all, right? And they want to create noise, basically, right? Their whole thing is, you have to have a lead story about some gaffe that some candidate made on the campaign trail.”
In some Murakami novel, I think Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World, a character wonders if the best way to understand the world isn't to just read the stockmarket page in the newspaper and ignore the news section. That popped into my head when I read this story.

In regards to Politico, it's always been a lame site catering to pretty low quality analysis and I'm glad between Silver and Charles Pierce (Politico = Teenbeat on the Potamac), it's fun to see it get lambasted a bit.

Speaking of which, between Nate Silver and Esquire's Charles Pierce, for all the complaining we do about the lameness of the political media, right there we have two geniuses we're damn lucky to have in this country. They're two to be thankful for...hoorah.

Bill Clinton is apparently a very charming person, a Rhodes Scholar, and formerly President of the USA. The Clinton Global Initiative does a bunch of things, but its focus seems to be identifying potential future leaders and motivating them via exposure to other world figures.

Frontline did an excellent report on dark money groups leading up to the election, and interviewed some folks at Priorities USA. The TL;DW version of their explanation for why they take dark money was that the ends justify the means, and since the bad guys are using dark money, they aren't going to fight with one hand tied behind their back. Not the most satisfying answer in the world.

Orly Taitz loses court case to access Obama's college records, Judge imposes $4000 sanction.

“Your opposition will constitute Obstruction of Justice, Aiding and Abetting in the elections fraud in forgery and treason in allowing a foreign citizen to usurp the U.S. Presidency with an aid of forged IDs and usurp the civil rights of the U.S. citizens,” she (Taitz) wrote. “At any rate your opposition and your attempt of intimidation and your allegiance or lack of allegiance to the United States of America is duly noted. Just make sure not to forget to bring with you Mr. Obama’s application, registration, and financial aid application.” ...

Taitz had a different point of view. “The judge did not give a damn about this country,” she wrote on her blog in response to the ruling. “Sadly he is not any different from all the other judges. I am yet to see one single judge who gives a damn about this nation. I feel like I am in Nazi Germany in the 1930s.”

If you look close at the scans, they're dated 11/16/2012. This is just a filing that will be rejected on procedural errors, of course, since the Wash DC Courts don't have jurisdiction over California. I don't know what she could possibly achieve by shopping around for a sympathetic judge who still has no jurisdiction. And I doubt she has paid a single penny for her tens of thousands of dollars of judicial sanctions, she can tie those up in court forever with more frivolous motions, which will just get her more sanctions. I don't understand why she hasn't been disbarred yet.

That "GOP Pollster" seems about on par clueless as the GE strategy was. Any debate about the economy would by necessity focus on plans and methods of the two men running, so it reverts to being a "Referendum on Obama" by default. 

There are a lot of reasons Romney lost, and if we are talking 'economics' then it is because Romney did not do his homework and present a cognizant plan to counter what was being done, which I guess is somewhat what the article is trying to say - but they are kinda living in fantasy land if they think a presidential campaign against an incumbent is anything but a referendum, even if they just talk economics.

Add to it "let Detroit go bankrupt" and the "47%" and Romney by no means presented himself as a viable alternative, or one that had a handle of macro economics.

The audience, like an overflowing freshman seminar with the cool professor, listens attentively as Strauss breaks down the fundamental issue with Silver's analysis of which states are most likely to swing back and forth. It assumes that the demographics most likely to swing one way or another are those in the middle. That's just not what the numbers say, Strauss insists. The problem, supposedly, is that Silver's information is limited to crude exit polling, whereas Strauss' information comes from phone calls and in-person contacts. "That's where it crumbles," he says. "That's where the house of cards fall down."

Dear lord, they STILL don't get it. 

2008: Silver correctly predicts the winner of 49 out of 50 states. He missed Indiana, which went to Obama by 1%. He was correct on all 35 Senate races. 
2010: Silver correctly predicts the winner in 34 out of 36 midterm elections.
2012: Silver correctly predicts the winner of all 50 states and Washington DC. He correctly predicts the winner in 31 of 33 Senate races. (He missed ND and MT)

I hope Strauss is sharing whatever the hell he's smoking with the rest of his audience. It's been three election cycles and Silver's had spectacular success rates in all of them.

I will say this -- Silver does value qualitative data like "phone calls and in-person contacts." In his book, for instance, he spends an entire chapter talking about the forecasts of baseball scouts versus pure SABR nerds, and explains how the scouts often do better because they have information that doesn't show up in SABR numbers. The hard part (and the part that the GOP probably overvalues their ability to do effectively) is valuing those qualitative assessments properly in the model. My guess is these GOP guys are vastly overestimating their forecasting ability based on these qualitative factors, though.

The view from the Millennials should scare the GOP. Here is one example:
Here is what I learned about politics in my formative years: Under a moderate Democrat president, the economy was doing well and we had budget surpluses, while the Republicans threw fits, shut down the government, and impeached him over bullshit. A Republican won a close election after which he might have been expected to try for a bipartisan approach in the face of a weak mandate, but instead pushed a strident conservative platform that, even before two wars, erased the budget surplus. Republicans got us into a quagmire in Iraq that (no disrespect to you) was obviously a bad idea from the beginning. When another moderate Democrat won election, Republicans engaged in an epic tantrum and behaved like babies for four years, culminating in a disgraceful Presidential field in 2012.

For the record, I am not a liberal. I would describe myself as a moderate libertarian, and my political idols are Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower. What has the Republican party done since 1995 to convince me that it has any positive vision for responsible governance, or any solutions to the problems facing the country and the world? What have they done that measures up to the legacy of our country's historical leaders? With the sheer audacity of the volte-faces they have made in the last couple decades on every issue, how can they be trusted with any power?

Former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) made a rare Senate appearance this morning, sitting in a wheelchair just off the floor so that members would have to see him as they entered the chamber.

It didn't work. The Senate killed the treaty this afternoon, with a final vote of 61 to 38, which seems like a lopsided majority, but which fell short of the two-thirds necessary for ratification. Eight Republicans broke ranks and joins Democrats in support of the treaty, but the clear majority of the Senate GOP voted to block it.

most Senate Republicans saw it as a threat to American "sovereignty," even though the treaty wouldn't have required the United States to change its laws.

No, I think edgeways is right. It's mostly redistricting/gerrymandering. Mother Jones has a simple chart that is effective in demonstrating the problem. From "Now That's What I Call Gerrymandering!"

quote:

Most Americans voted for Democratic representation in the House. The votes are still being counted, but as of now it looks as if Democrats have a slight edge in the popular vote for House seats, 49 percent-48.2 percent, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. Still, as the Post's Aaron Blake notes, the 233-195 seat majority the GOP will likely end up with represents the GOP's "second-biggest House majority in 60 years and their third-biggest since the Great Depression."

Public Policy Polling's first post election national poll: Republicans not handling election results well


Some choice bits:

49% of GOP voters nationally say they think that ACORN stole the election for President Obama. We found that 52% of Republicans thought that ACORN stole the 2008 election for Obama, so this is a modest decline, but perhaps smaller than might have been expected given that ACORN doesn't exist anymore.

....

Grover Norquist is largely unknown nationally, and among voters who are familiar with him he is generally disliked. Only 15% have a favorable opinion of him to 37% with a negative one, with 48% not holding an opinion one way or the other. Even among Republicans just 18% see him positively, while 23% have an unfavorable view. Only 23% of voters think it's important for politicians to follow Norquist's tax pledge to 39% who think it's not important and 38% who don't have an opinion.

-----

The 39% of Americans with an opinion about Bowles/Simpson is only slightly higher than the 25% with one about Panetta/Burns, a mythical Clinton Chief of Staff/former western Republican Senator combo we conceived of to test how many people would say they had an opinion even about something that doesn't exist.

Right Fears `Purge' As GOP Leadership Takes Control
Conservatives fear they're being pushed aside by Republican leaders as the party looks to regroup from its election losses. 
...
"At the end of the day we lost seats in the House, we lost seats in the Senate, we couldn't win the presidency, and the response is to purge conservatives," Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) said Tuesday during a briefing at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington.

Huelskamp is one of four Republicans who were stripped of committee seats this week for bucking leadership over the last term. Huelskamp lost his spot on the Budget Committee, where he voted against the House GOP's budget last year along with Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI), who also was removed this week. David Schweikert (R-AZ) and Walter Jones (R-NC), who also voted against the budget from the right, lost seats on the Financial Services Committee.

While I think that there is certainly some consideration on the Democratic team about how to embarrass the GOP on taxes, the way the situation is currently set up, Repubs, if they are smart, can get away with simply not voting to continue a tax cut, which is different. In other words, the Bush tax give-away is scheduled to end Jan 1, so for taxes to go up across the board, the GOP need do nothing. To lower them on the 98% is to vote for a tax decrease. There is still rhetorical power in this position for the Democrats vis-a-vis how the GOP likes to talk about taxes, but it's not quite the same as getting them to vote for an increase.

I agree, except that over the last four years Republicans have done everything in their power to obscure this distinction during campaigns, calling every suggestions that the tax breaks expire a "tax hike" as in "with the economy the way it is, we can't risk a tax hike."

Siince the target audience for what I'm talking about is Republican primary voters, I think they've destroyed this escape hatch. Karma.

I think that the GOP primary voters will be able to handle the cognitive dissonance. At least they have in the past when things like this have come up. What I do think, as I alluded to, is that this will have an effect on how the GOP gets to talk about "tax hikes" in the future.

How The Voter ID Crusade Backfired On Republicans

Hell, it made me want to vote more, and I'm not even a "minority" nor an Obama voter.

If the Democrats were smart, they'd come up with another pro-voting initiative like the motor-voter bill. It's been a loooong time. Conservatives bluster b/c they don't want everyone voting, but the general electorate eats that shit up. Enable voting instead of hindering it and you will get more votes. It's simple.

We can stop the fiscal cliff with the bill that House Republicans already passed that simply extends the current tax rates and replaces the defense cuts with...


-Jim DeMint

As said before, there are no fiscal conservatives, just different priorities. DeMint could balance the budget with defense cuts alone, but he values that spending too highly, so the solution is to "...replaces the defense cuts with reductions in wasteful spending." You know, you could actually do both, raise taxes on the 3%, institute capitol gains taxes, tax all money made in America, or by people living in America, even if the money is stored off shore and hardly touch the safety net at all. 

First on the wasteful spending chopping block, medical packages for congressional members, purchase it on the freeeeeee market baby.

The shame of it is that defense spending is amongst the most wasteful — it's some of the only government spending that doesn't have a positive multiplier for the general economy. (In part, this is because we demand a cutting-edge military, and that means researching a lot of things that don't pan out. But also because we build huge things with little coherent oversight and little incentive to complete efficiently.)

In fact, just about the only place where the conservative argument that government spending is inherently wasteful aligns with the facts of this reality is in defense spending. Most social programs do pretty well.

Why Are We Fascinated With Post-Election Romney? Excerpt:
I suspect it goes to something more fundamental in the human psyche: our fascination with fate. Put bluntly, it's rare in this day and age for us to witness a divergence of outcome as radical as what has just occurred with Mitt Romney. Here was a man who was awfully close—if not as close as he thought—to being elected leader of the free world. If a few hundred thousand votes had swung a different way in a few key states, he would have been presiding over the reshaping of the American tax code and federal budget in the year to come, dismantling the biggest piece of domestic policy legislation in more than three decades, and taking the reins on confronting Iran's mullahs. A special Secret Service team—code-name Hawkeye Javelin—was standing by on Election Night in Boston to swoop in and supplement protection for the president-elect. Instead, the agents melted away, and Romney was driven home by his son Tagg.

JHarris: I don't get where Obama saying "You're likable enough, Hillary" is petty?

Yeah, me neither. To my memory Hilary was a bit stung by the suggestion, and seemed at a loss for words and Obama was just being partially a wiseass and partially conciliatory. 

Let's not forget that one of Obama's closest foreign policy advisers at the time, the supremely intelligent Samantha Power, had in a moment of repulsion with Hillary's campaign style said she was "a monster," and was quickly taken off the campaign and put out of the running for a an Obama appointment if he won. {But I would venture Power is going to get something in Obama's second term, and that's a good thing.}

But going back to Hillary, there's no doubt she plays to win and plays for keeps, and so does her hubby (who's amazingly, considering the Lewinsky stuff has still managed to become, deservedly, this beloved American stateman. LOLZ.).

But also there was the real concern from the Hilary camp that she might not appear tough enough for the office of POTUS, during a time of two wars, which strikes me now, as downright quaint. 

I don't know a woman running for the office at this point would have to work as hard to appear to be such a hard ass and all set to chew glass and take out the whole AQ and Talibaners network with her own hands if necessary. Clinton really was a pioneer, and I thnk she's definitely going to run and in four years, a thread similar to this one and the "MotherThread" will go at great and long length discussing her and the other candidates, so I'm going to end this thread with encouragement for Hillary:

I can't find the numbers right now — the gradual fiscal ditch seems to be taking up all the google juice — but basically the general consensus (and someone will be sure to correct me if I misremember) is that military spending ends up with, at best, a 1.5 percent multiplier in terms of economic stimulus, but investing in things like education and infrastructure leads to multipliers between 2 and 5 percent. Given limited resources, it makes more economic sense to divest from the military — especially given that military spending hits the diminishing returns point sooner — and invest in domestic infrastructure and education.

I don't think there's any reputable info on the multiplier for defense spending specifically. This EPI paper has a table showing multipliers for various things (search the page for for "Appendix Table 1") but the closest you get is a breakdown of safety net stuff, infrastructure, and "other government spending."

A Romney advisor hilariously claimed defense spending had five times the multiplier of entitlement spending during the campaign, but I think we can safely discount that.

It came across as arrogant and condescending. Perhaps more so to those of us who supported her who were receiving an aggressive brush-off on every Democratic-leaning website, (such as Daily Kos) by Obama supporters. 

It was an ugly primary campaign. Obama had difficulty courting women's rights groups, not just because Clinton was a woman, but because she was a known quantity and he was not. Obama's supporters were attacked as sexist and Clinton's as racist. 

He made a joke. It fell flat and did not make him look good. And it won her New Hampshire. 

I could be wrong about this, but I suspect it was a perception that he was being impolite to a woman on national television that mattered to the electorate. Probably more so because he was black. There's an unfair double standard which has been set for Obama, I think. As an African-American man, his behavior was being (and still is) scrutinized by people ready to take offense at even the slightest whiff of impropriety. That might have been a factor, too. 

During the 1990 Texas gubernatorial race, there was a debate between governor Ann Richards and Clayton Williams. Williams refused to shake Richards hand, leaving her standing with her hand outstretched, looking awkward. This was a guy whose poll numbers had remained relatively high even after he'd made a rape joke: "If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it," back in March. Going into August, he led in the polls by close to a dozen points. As Molly Ivins quipped at the time, Texans had no problem with a candidate making a rape joke, but they wouldn't stand for him being disrespectful right to a woman's face. It wasn't gentlemanly. Williams lost the election. The incident wasn't his only misstep, but it was a biggie. 

The two incidents differ in degree but perhaps the backlash was similar.

I was thinking today that maybe it's identity politics but still, we re-elected a black guy named Barack Hussein Obama to the presidency of the United States. My mom died this summer and after most of a lifetime of civil rights activism starting in the mid-sixties, she actually lived to see a black president. In her last few years as she got sicker, the glossy photo that the Obama campaign sent her for what must have been a tiny contribution was one of her prize possessions. She was born in 1933 and was very close to her grandmother who had actually been born on a plantation in North Carolina during the Civil War. Sometimes it good to step back and remember how far we've really come.

But doesn't a multiplier of 1.5 contradict your earlier statement that defense spending isn't nearly as stimulative as infrastructure, etc.? Zandi comes up with 1.44 for infrastructure, and just a bit more for unemployment benefits. If anything, 1.5 sounds awfully high to me.

In 2012, presidential election spending reached $6 billion and created all kinds of jobs, from community organizers to campaign managers, advertisers, web designers and political consultants. According to the Combined Federal Campaign website “more than 35,000 campaign workers serve the campaign every year, training, fundraising, engagement leaders, event planning, recording donations and more.”

Nevertheless, with the end of election season, campaign jobs vanish, leaving campaign workers in an uncertainty of post-election unemployment, which starts immediately.

Look, if you've had fun in this thread, you didn't get there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart. There are a lot of smart MeFiites out there. It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking MeFiites out there.

If you enjoyed this thread, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great moderator somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable MetaFilter that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in routers and servers.

If you enjoyed this thread -- you didn't build that -- somebody else made that happen. MetaFilter didn't get invented on its own. matthowie created MetaFilter so that all the MeFiites could enjoy MetaFilter. The point is, is that when we succeed, we succeed because of our individual comments, but also because we discuss things together. There are some things, just like fighting flame wars, we don't do on our own. I mean, imagine if everybody had moderator privileges. That would be a hard way to organize fighting flame wars.

So we say to ourselves, ever since the founding of this site, you know what, there are some things we do better together. That's how we built the longboats. That's how we created the epic threads. That's how we built the "my job is is not to worry about those people" and the "Sarah Palin as McCain's Running-mate". That's how we built MetaFilter. That's how we sent a thread to the moon. We rise or fall together as one user base and as one community.

"But doesn't a multiplier of 1.5 contradict your earlier statement that defense spending isn't nearly as stimulative as infrastructure, etc.? Zandi comes up with 1.44 for infrastructure, and just a bit more for unemployment benefits. If anything, 1.5 sounds awfully high to me."

No, that's addressed in the paper, at least tangentially. They base their methodology on studies that found between a 1.5 and 2.5 multiplier for all governmental spending, and while the researchers still think 1.5 sounds high for the military, they explain that by noting that military spending compared regionally gives a frame without countervailing monetary and taxation policy.
This difference between the response of national policy to a regional spending shock and an aggregate spending shock implies that the government spending multiplier we estimate, in effect, is conditioning on a relatively accommodative monetary and tax policy response. This likely explains why our multiplier estimate is higher than those of, eg Barro and Redlick (2011) and Ramey (2011).

That meme that jokingly made the guy sound like some kind of superhuman? Yeah, we feel kind of stupid for it now.

From "Maybe An Hour Is Long Enough To Wait," above, I can understand the purpose behind it and agree it's necessary. But do they have to call it "The LINE Act," with LINE standing for "Lines Interfere with National Elections?" Leave the stupid acronyms to the Republicans please.

Regarding Paul Broun, sadly, the moron is from my state.

Obama Will Not Play That Game
“If the Congress in any way suggests they are going to tie negotiations to the debt ceiling and take us to the brink of default once again as part of a budget negotiation… I will not play that game because we’ve got to break that habit before it starts.”
Man gets elected President, all of a sudden starts thinking he's in charge or something.

The Counties That Cost Romney the Election. [NYT] Excerpt:
When it comes to presidential politics in Pennsylvania, Republicans are like the comic strip character Charlie Brown, who prepares to kick a football, only to have it pulled back every time by his pal Lucy.

This time, it was Mitt Romney who was tempted to go for the prize, and his camp poured $10 million into Pennsylvania in the closing weeks of the U.S. presidential campaign. He lost by more than five points in that state, suffering the same fate as every one of his party’s nominees in the previous five presidential elections.

To understand why, look at two suburban counties near Philadelphia: Delaware, a middle-class enclave, and Montgomery, a more affluent area. Republicans win many of the local offices in Montgomery and Delaware, and until a few decades ago, so did the party’s presidential nominees. This November, President Barack Obama carried both counties by about 60,000 votes.

The No-Good, Very Bad Outlook For The Working-Class American Man
The U.S. economy has weakened, and much needs fixing—beyond the fiscal cliff—if it’s to regain its strength. A reelected President Obama and a still-divided Congress face a lengthy To Do list for the economy. We’ve chosen eight entries: innovation, jobs, rising health care costs, entitlement programs, college-completion rates, infrastructure, housing, and retirement security. None of them will be easy to fix.

Hispanic campaign donors look for new ways to flex their political muscle. Excerpt:
One of the most remarked-on stories of the 2012 election was the impact of the nation’s rapidly growing Hispanic population at the ballot box. Largely overlooked was the emergence of a cadre of wealthy Latinos as a force in political fundraising.

Especially successful was a network called the Futuro Fund, organized by television star Eva Lon­goria, San Antonio architectural-design-firm owner Henry Muñoz III and San Juan lawyer Andres W. Lopez. It pulled in upward of $30 million toward President Obama’s reelection.

“We wanted to make sure the Latino community stops being a number and starts being looked at as a market,” Longoria said in an interview. “It may have been a shock to some, but not if you look at trends in Hispanic buying power.”

Now the three are pondering how to build a Latino political organization that will help shape the national debate — not only on such issues as immigration laws and Puerto Rico statehood, but also on education and economic opportunity for Latinos.

“If we are ever going to get what we want, we have to be politically involved,” Muñoz said. “Politics has a currency. It has votes and money. Our community has been known for votes, and now it has to be known for money.”

That, however, is a tall order. An Associated Press survey found that while Hispanics account for 16 percent of the population, less than 4 percent of itemized political contributions (those of $200 or more) during the 2012 campaign came from predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods.

Obama vows progress with tribes. Excerpt:
President Obama promised Native American leaders Wednesday he will “keep working together” with them, and outlined policy changes across his administration that Native Americans long have sought.

Federal officials will pay the medical bills of Native Americans who have served in the armed forces, and tribes won’t have to pay taxes on aid to their members, administration officials said.

The White House also announced millions of dollars in new transportation grants and new programs to help schools on reservations.

“But we’ve got more work to do,” Obama said at the daylong White House Tribal Nations Conference. “We’ve got to rebuild America’s infrastructure — from roads to high-speed Internet — that will help connect native communities to other parts of the country and other parts of the world.”

Chris Cillizza: The leaderless Republican party — and why it matters. Excerpt:
What’s left is a Republican party without a leader, a body without a head. And, that lack of a single individual to push the party in a specific direction is already hurting the GOP with cracks appearing in the party’s approach to the fiscal cliff negotiations.

First it was Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole proposing that his party pass the tax cut extension for all but the top two percent of earners, pushing that debate over rates for the wealthiest until the next Congress.Then it was Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn insisting that his preferred option would be to raise rates on the wealthy rather than cap deductions.

That fissured approach stands in stark contrast to the generally unified approach that Democrats have enjoyed thanks to President Obama’s bully pulpit.

GOPocalypse: A Guide to Republican Purges. Excerpt:
Between an electoral defeat that was wholly unexpected (by them, anyway) and a “fiscal cliff” that will compel them to support a tax increase, Republicans are experiencing present political reality as a sort of Apocalypse. That's how it feels, anyway; eventually they will adjust. But for now they’re channeling their resentment into internecine warfare, creating a tableau vivant of pitched battle and unending recrimination that Hieronymus Bosch could have set against a landscape of burning lakes and whirling locusts. It is deeply satisfying to behold. But there’s so much bile flying in so many directions that the uninitiated can find it difficult to keep track of who’s purging whom, and why. Here follows a guide to some of the more interesting enmities.
